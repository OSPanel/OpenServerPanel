mysqld_multi.pl version 2.16 by Jani Tolonen

Description:
mysqld_multi.pl can be used to start, reload, or stop any number of separate
mysqld processes running in different TCP/IP ports and UNIX sockets.

mysqld_multi.pl can read group [mysqld_multi] from my.cnf file. You may
want to put options mysqld=... and mysqladmin=... there.  Since
version 2.10 these options can also be given under groups [mysqld#],
which gives more control over different versions.  One can have the
default mysqld and mysqladmin under group [mysqld_multi], but this is
not mandatory. Please note that if mysqld or mysqladmin is missing
from both [mysqld_multi] and [mysqld#], a group that is tried to be
used, mysqld_multi.pl will abort with an error.

mysqld_multi.pl will search for groups named [mysqld#] from my.cnf (or
the given --defaults-extra-file=...), where '#' can be any positive 
integer starting from 1. These groups should be the same as the regular
[mysqld] group, but with those port, socket and any other options
that are to be used with each separate mysqld process. The number
in the group name has another function; it can be used for starting,
reloading, stopping, or reporting any specific mysqld server.

Usage: mysqld_multi.pl [OPTIONS] {start|reload|stop|report} [GNR,GNR,GNR...]
or     mysqld_multi.pl [OPTIONS] {start|reload|stop|report} [GNR-GNR,GNR,GNR-GNR,...]

The GNR means the group number. You can start, reload, stop or report any GNR,
or several of them at the same time. (See --example) The GNRs list can
be comma separated or a dash combined. The latter means that all the
GNRs between GNR1-GNR2 will be affected. Without GNR argument all the
groups found will either be started, reloaded, stopped, or reported. Note that
syntax for specifying GNRs must appear without spaces.

Options:

These options must be given before any others:
--no-defaults      Do not read any defaults file
--defaults-file=...  Read only this configuration file, do not read the
                   standard system-wide and user-specific files
--defaults-extra-file=...  Read this configuration file in addition to the
                   standard system-wide and user-specific files
Using:  

--example          Give an example of a config file with extra information.
--help             Print this help and exit.
--log=...          Log file. Full path to and the name for the log file. NOTE:
                   If the file exists, everything will be appended.
                   Using: 
--mysqladmin=...   mysqladmin binary to be used for a server shutdown.
                   Since version 2.10 this can be given within groups [mysqld#]
                   Using: 
--mysqld=...       mysqld binary to be used. Note that you can give mysqld_safe
                   to this option also. The options are passed to mysqld. Just
                   make sure you have mysqld in your PATH or fix mysqld_safe.
                   Using: 
                   Please note: Since mysqld_multi version 2.3 you can also
                   give this option inside groups [mysqld#] in ~/.my.cnf,
                   where '#' stands for an integer (number) of the group in
                   question. This will be recognised as a special option and
                   will not be passed to the mysqld. This will allow one to
                   start different mysqld versions with mysqld_multi.
--no-log           Print to stdout instead of the log file. By default the log
                   file is turned on.
--password=...     Password for mysqladmin user.
--silent           Disable warnings.
--tcp-ip           Connect to the MySQL server(s) via the TCP/IP port instead
                   of the UNIX socket. This affects stopping and reporting.
                   If a socket file is missing, the server may still be
                   running, but can be accessed only via the TCP/IP port.
                   By default connecting is done via the UNIX socket.
--user=...         mysqladmin user. Using: root
--verbose          Be more verbose.
--version          Print the version number and exit.
