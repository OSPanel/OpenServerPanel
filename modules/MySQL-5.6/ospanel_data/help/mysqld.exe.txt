Starts the MySQL database server.

Usage: mysqld.exe [OPTIONS]
NT and Win32 specific options:
  --install                     Install the default service (NT).
  --install-manual              Install the default service started manually (NT).
  --install service_name        Install an optional service (NT).
  --install-manual service_name Install an optional service started manually (NT).
  --remove                      Remove the default service from the service list (NT).
  --remove service_name         Remove the service_name from the service list (NT).
  --enable-named-pipe           Only to be used for the default server (NT).
  --standalone                  Dummy option to start as a standalone server (NT).


Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
C:\Windows\my.ini C:\Windows\my.cnf C:\my.ini C:\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MySQL-5.6\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MySQL-5.6\my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysqld server mysqld-5.6
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults        Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults           Don't read default options from any option file,
                        except for login file.
--defaults-file=#       Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
                        Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=#          Read this path from the login file.

  --abort-slave-event-count=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.
  --allow-suspicious-udfs 
                      Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
                      without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
                      also means that one can load any function from any
                      library, for example exit() from libc.so
  -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
                      will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
  --archive[=name]    Enable or disable ARCHIVE plugin. Possible values are ON,
                      OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
                      Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
  --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
                      Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
                      auto-increment-increment != 1
  --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
  --automatic-sp-privileges 
                      Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
  --avoid-temporal-upgrade 
                      When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
                      are not upgraded to the new format for ALTER TABLE
                      requests ADD/CHANGE/MODIFY COLUMN, ADD INDEX or FORCE
                      operation. This variable is deprecated and will be
                      removed in a future release.
  --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MySQL can
                      have. This comes into play when the main MySQL thread
                      gets very many connection requests in a very short time
  -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
                      resolved relative to this
  --big-tables        Allow big result sets by saving all temporary sets on
                      file (Solves most 'table full' errors)
  --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
  --binlog-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the transactional cache for updates to
                      transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
                      use transactions containing many statements, you can
                      increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-checksum=name 
                      Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
                      events in the binary log. Possible values are NONE and
                      CRC32; default is CRC32.
  --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
                      Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
                      statement format to be written directly to binary log.
                      Before using this option make sure that there are no
                      dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
                      tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
                      SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
                      from the master.
  --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
                      database, and exclude all others not explicitly
                      mentioned.
  --binlog-error-action=name 
                      When statements cannot be written to the binary log due
                      to a fatal error, the server can either ignore the error
                      and let the master continue, or abort.
  --binlog-format=name 
                      What form of binary logging the master will use: either
                      ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
                      statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
                      statement-based binary logging except for those
                      statements where only row-based is correct: those which
                      involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
                      function; for those, row-based binary logging is
                      automatically used. If NDBCLUSTER is enabled and
                      binlog-format is MIXED, the format switches to row-based
                      and back implicitly per each query accessing an
                      NDBCLUSTER table
  --binlog-gtid-simple-recovery 
                      If this option is enabled, the server does not open more
                      than two binary logs when initializing GTID_PURGED and
                      GTID_EXECUTED, either during server restart or when
                      binary logs are being purged. Enabling this option is
                      useful when the server has already generated many binary
                      logs without GTID events (e.g., having GTID_MODE = OFF).
                      Note: If this option is enabled, GLOBAL.GTID_EXECUTED and
                      GLOBAL.GTID_PURGED may be initialized wrongly in two
                      cases: (1) GTID_MODE was ON for some binary logs but OFF
                      for the newest binary log. (2) SET GTID_PURGED was issued
                      after the oldest existing binary log was generated. If a
                      wrong set is computed in one of case (1) or case (2), it
                      will remain wrong even if the server is later restarted
                      with this option disabled.
  --binlog-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the master that updates to the given database
                      should not be logged to the binary log.
  --binlog-max-flush-queue-time=# 
                      The maximum time that the binary log group commit will
                      keep reading transactions before it flush the
                      transactions to the binary log (and optionally sync,
                      depending on the value of sync_binlog).
  --binlog-order-commits 
                      Issue internal commit calls in the same order as
                      transactions are written to the binary log. Default is to
                      order commits.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-order-commits to disable.)
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
  --binlog-row-image=name 
                      Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
                      'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
                      columns in the before and after image are logged.
                      'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
                      whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
                      not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
                      equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
                      the table) is logged in the before image, and only
                      changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
                      FULL).
  --binlog-rows-query-log-events 
                      Allow writing of Rows_query_log events into binary log.
  --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the statement cache for updates to
                      non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
                      often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
                      can increase this to get more performance
  --binlogging-impossible-mode=name 
                      On a fatal error when statements cannot be binlogged the
                      behaviour can be ignore the error and let the master
                      continue or abort the server. This variable is deprecated
                      and will be removed in a future release. Please use
                      binlog_error_action instead.
  --blackhole[=name]  Enable or disable BLACKHOLE plugin. Possible values are
                      ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --block-encryption-mode=name 
                      mode for AES_ENCRYPT/AES_DECRYPT
  --bootstrap         Used by mysql installation scripts.
  --bulk-insert-buffer-size=# 
                      Size of tree cache used in bulk insert optimisation. Note
                      that this is a limit per thread!
  --character-set-client-handshake 
                      Don't ignore client side character set value sent during
                      handshake.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-character-set-client-handshake to disable.)

                      NEVER, AUTO, ALWAYS
  --connect-timeout=# The number of seconds the mysqld server is waiting for a
                      connect packet before responding with 'Bad handshake'

  --delay-key-write[=name] 
                      Type of DELAY_KEY_WRITE
  --delayed-insert-limit=# 
                      After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
                      DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
                      statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
                      before continuing. This variable is deprecated along with
                      INSERT DELAYED.
  --delayed-insert-timeout=# 
                      How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
                      statements before terminating.This variable is deprecated
                      along with INSERT DELAYED.
  --delayed-queue-size=# 
                      What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for
                      handling INSERT DELAYED. If the queue becomes full, any
                      client that does INSERT DELAYED will wait until there is
                      room in the queue again.This variable is deprecated along
                      with INSERT DELAYED.

                      error
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-disconnect-on-expired-password to disable.)
  --disconnect-slave-event-count=# 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.
  --div-precision-increment=# 
                      Precision of the result of '/' operator will be increased
                      on that value
  --end-markers-in-json 
                      In JSON output ("EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON" and optimizer
                      trace), if variable is set to 1, repeats the structure's
                      key (if it has one) near the closing bracket
  --enforce-gtid-consistency 
                      Prevents execution of statements that would be impossible
                      to log in a transactionally safe manner. Currently, the
                      disallowed statements include CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE
                      inside transactions, all updates to non-transactional
                      tables, and CREATE TABLE ... SELECT.
  --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
                      The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
                      of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
                      equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
                      this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.
  --event-scheduler[=name] 
                      Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
                      and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
                      deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
  -T, --exit-info[=#] Used for debugging. Use at your own risk.
  --expire-logs-days=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      expire_logs_days days; possible purges happen at startup
                      and at binary log rotation
  --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
                      This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
                      columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
                      option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
                      DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated.
  --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
                      With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
                      (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
                      Disable with --skip-external-locking.
  --federated[=name]  Enable or disable FEDERATED plugin. Possible values are
                      ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load).
  --flush             Flush MyISAM tables to disk between SQL commands

  --ft-max-word-len=# The maximum length of the word to be included in a
                      FULLTEXT index. Note: FULLTEXT indexes must be rebuilt
                      after changing this variable
  --ft-min-word-len=# The minimum length of the word to be included in a
                      FULLTEXT index. Note: FULLTEXT indexes must be rebuilt
                      after changing this variable
  --ft-query-expansion-limit=# 
                      Number of best matches to use for query expansion
  --ft-stopword-file=name 
                      Use stopwords from this file instead of built-in list
  --gdb               Set up signals usable for debugging.
  --general-log       Log connections and queries to a table or log file.
                      Defaults logging to a file hostname.log or a table

                      GROUP_CONCAT()
  --gtid-mode=name    Whether Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) are
                      enabled. Can be ON or OFF.
  -?, --help          Display this help and exit.

                      When turned OFF, InnoDB will assume that the zlib
                      compression algorithm doesn't change.

                      strongly recommended to avoid replication problems if
                      server's hostname changes) argument should be the chosen

                      used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
                      allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
                      if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
                      logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
                      ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
                      do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
                      can safely set this to TRUE
  --log-bin-use-v1-row-events 
                      If equal to 1 then version 1 row events are written to a
                      row based binary log.  If equal to 0, then the latest
                      version of events are written.  This option is useful
                      during some upgrades.

  --log-slave-updates Tells the slave to log the updates from the slave thread
                      to the binary log. You will need to turn it on if you

  --log-slow-admin-statements 
                      Log slow OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, ALTER and other

                      transactions that affect more than one storage engine,
                      when binary log is disabled).
  --log-tc-size=#     Size of transaction coordinator log.
  --log-throttle-queries-not-using-indexes[=#] 
                      Log at most this many 'not using index' warnings per

                      condensed into a single summary line. A value of 0
                      disables throttling. Option has no effect unless
                      --log_queries_not_using_indexes is set.
  -W, --log-warnings[=#] 
                      Log some not critical warnings to the log file
  --long-query-time=# Log all queries that have taken more than long_query_time

                      to 2 if you are using a case insensitive file system
  --master-info-file=name 
                      The location and name of the file that remembers the

                      master's binlogs.
  --master-info-repository=name 
                      Defines the type of the repository for the master

                      name is the plugin name and library is the plugin library
                      in plugin_dir. This option adds to the list speficied by
                      --plugin-load in an incremental way. Multiple
                      --plugin-load-add are supported.

                      Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a
                      buffer of this size for each table it scans. If you do
                      many sequential scans, you may want to increase this
                      value
  --read-only         Make all non-temporary tables read-only, with the
                      exception for replication (slave) threads and users with

                      Defines the type of the repository for the relay log
                      information and associated workers.
  --relay-log-purge   if disabled - do not purge relay logs. if enabled - purge
                      them as soon as they are no more needed
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-relay-log-purge to disable.)
  --relay-log-recovery 
                      Enables automatic relay log recovery right after the
                      database startup, which means that the IO Thread starts
                      re-fetching from the master right after the last
                      transaction processed
  --relay-log-space-limit=# 
                      Maximum space to use for all relay logs
  --replicate-do-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified database. To specify more than one database,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      This option will not work if you use cross database
                      updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
                      sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-ignore-db.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
  --replicate-same-server-id 
                      In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
                      our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
                      loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
                      --log-slave-updates is used.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
                      that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
                      than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
                      to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
                      table names start with bar.
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
                      SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
                      slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
                      not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
                      the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
                      NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
                      for connecting to the slave from the master or other
                      hosts
  --report-password=name 
                      The account password of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If
                      not sure, leave this option unset
  --report-user=name  The account user name of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --rpl-stop-slave-timeout=# 
                      Timeout in seconds to wait for slave to stop before
                      returning a warning.

  --secure-file-priv=name 
                      Limit LOAD DATA, SELECT ... OUTFILE, and LOAD_FILE() to
                      files within specified directory

                      A fully qualified path to the public RSA key used for
                      authentication
  --shared-memory     Enable the shared memory
  --shared-memory-base-name=name 
                      Base name of shared memory
  --show-old-temporals 
                      When this option is enabled, the pre-5.6.4 temporal types
                      will be marked in the 'SHOW CREATE TABLE' and
                      'INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS' table as a comment in
                      COLUMN_TYPE field. This variable is deprecated and will
                      be removed in a future release.
  --show-slave-auth-info 
                      Show user and password in SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on this
                      master.

                      Legal values are STRICT (default) and IDEMPOTENT. In
                      IDEMPOTENT mode, replication will not stop for operations
                      that are idempotent. In STRICT mode, replication will
                      stop on any unexpected difference between the master and
                      the slave
  --slave-load-tmpdir=name 
                      The location where the slave should put its temporary

  --slave-sql-verify-checksum 
                      Force checksum verification of replication events after
                      reading them from relay log. Note: Events are always
                      checksum-verified by slave on receiving them from the
                      network before writing them to the relay log. Enabled by
                      default.

  --slave-type-conversions=name 
                      Set of slave type conversions that are enabled. Legal
                      values are: ALL_LOSSY to enable lossy conversions,

                      ALL_UNSIGNED to treat all integer column type data to be
                      unsigned values, and ALL_SIGNED to treat all integer
                      column type data to be signed values. Default treatment
                      is ALL_SIGNED. If ALL_SIGNED and ALL_UNSIGNED both are
                      specifed, ALL_SIGNED will take high priority than
                      ALL_UNSIGNED. If the variable is assigned the empty set,
                      no conversions are allowed and it is expected that the
                      types match exactly.
