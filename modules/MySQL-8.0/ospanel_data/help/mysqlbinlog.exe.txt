Usage: mysqlbinlog.exe [options] log-files
  -?, --help          Display this help and exit.
  --base64-output=name 
                      Determine when the output statements should be
                      base64-encoded BINLOG statements: 'never' disables it and
                      works only for binlogs without row-based events;
                      'decode-rows' decodes row events into commented
                      pseudo-SQL statements if the --verbose option is also
                      given; 'auto' prints base64 only when necessary (i.e.,
                      for row-based events and format description events).  If
                      no --base64-output[=name] option is given at all, the
                      default is 'auto'.
  --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
  --character-sets-dir=name 
                      Directory for character set files.
  -d, --database=name List entries for just this database (local log only).
  --rewrite-db=name   Rewrite the row event to point so that it can be applied
                      to a new database
  -#, --debug[=#]     This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  --debug-check       This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  --debug-info        This is a non-debug version. Catch this and exit.
  --default-auth=name Default authentication client-side plugin to use.
  -D, --disable-log-bin 
                      Disable binary log. This is useful, if you enabled
                      --to-last-log and are sending the output to the same
                      MySQL server. This way you could avoid an endless loop.
                      You would also like to use it when restoring after a
                      crash to avoid duplication of the statements you already
                      have. NOTE: you will need a SUPER privilege to use this
                      option.
  -F, --force-if-open If the IN_USE flag is set in the first event, run
                      anyways, and do not fail in case the file ends with a
                      truncated event. The IN_USE flag is set only for the
                      binary log that is currently written by the server; in
                      case the server has crashed, the flag remains set until
                      the server is started up again and recovers the binary
                      log. Without -F, mysqlbinlog refuses to process file with
                      the flag set. Since the server may be writing the file,
                      it is considered normal that the last event is truncated.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-force-if-open to disable.)
  -f, --force-read    Force reading unknown binlog events.
  -H, --hexdump       Augment output with hexadecimal and ASCII event dump.
  -h, --host=name     Get the binlog from server.
  -i, --idempotent    Notify the server to use idempotent mode before applying
                      Row Events
  -l, --local-load=name 
                      Prepare local temporary files for LOAD DATA INFILE in the
                      specified directory.
  -o, --offset=#      Skip the first N entries.
  -p, --password[=name] 
                      Password to connect to remote server.
  --plugin-dir=name   Directory for client-side plugins.
  -P, --port=#        Port number to use for connection or 0 for default to, in
                      order of preference, my.cnf, $MYSQL_TCP_PORT,
                      /etc/services, built-in default (3306).
  --protocol=name     The protocol to use for connection (tcp, socket, pipe,
                      memory).
  -R, --read-from-remote-server 
                      Read binary logs from a MySQL server. This is an alias
                      for read-from-remote-source=BINLOG-DUMP-NON-GTIDS.
  --read-from-remote-master=name 
                      This option is deprecated and will be removed in a future
                      version. Use read-from-remote-source instead.
  --read-from-remote-source=name 
                      Read binary logs from a MySQL server through the
                      COM_BINLOG_DUMP or COM_BINLOG_DUMP_GTID commands by
                      setting the option to either BINLOG-DUMP-NON-GTIDS or
                      BINLOG-DUMP-GTIDS, respectively. If
                      --read-from-remote-source=BINLOG-DUMP-GTIDS is combined
                      with --exclude-gtids, transactions are filtered out on
                      the source, to avoid unnecessary network traffic.
  --raw               Requires -R. Output raw binlog data instead of SQL
                      statements, output is to log files.
  -r, --result-file=name 
                      Direct output to a given file. With --raw this is a
                      prefix for the file names.
  --server-id=#       Extract only binlog entries created by the server having
                      the given id.
  --server-id-bits=#  Set number of significant bits in server-id
  --set-charset=name  Add 'SET NAMES character_set' to the output.
  --shared-memory-base-name=name 
                      Base name of shared memory.
  -s, --short-form    Just show regular queries: no extra info and no row-based
                      events. This is for testing only, and should not be used
                      in production systems. If you want to suppress
                      base64-output, consider using --base64-output=never
                      instead.
  -S, --socket=name   The socket file to use for connection.
  --server-public-key-path=name 
                      File path to the server public RSA key in PEM format.
  --get-server-public-key 
                      Get server public key
  --ssl-mode=name     SSL connection mode.
  --ssl-ca=name       CA file in PEM format.
  --ssl-capath=name   CA directory.
  --ssl-cert=name     X509 cert in PEM format.
  --ssl-cipher=name   SSL cipher to use.
  --ssl-key=name      X509 key in PEM format.
  --ssl-crl=name      Certificate revocation list.
  --ssl-crlpath=name  Certificate revocation list path.
  --tls-version=name  TLS version to use, permitted values are: TLSv1.2,
                      TLSv1.3
  --ssl-fips-mode=name 
                      SSL FIPS mode (applies only for OpenSSL); permitted
                      values are: OFF, ON, STRICT
  --tls-ciphersuites=name 
                      TLS v1.3 cipher to use.
  --ssl-session-data=name 
                      Session data file to use to enable ssl session reuse
  --ssl-session-data-continue-on-failed-reuse 
                      If set to ON, this option will allow connection to
                      succeed even if session data cannot be reused.
  --start-datetime=name 
                      Start reading the binlog at first event having a datetime
                      equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be
                      a date and time in the local time zone, in any format
                      accepted by the MySQL server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP
                      types, for example: 2004-12-25 11:25:56 (you should
                      probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly).
  -j, --start-position=# 
                      Start reading the binlog at position N. Applies to the
                      first binlog passed on the command line.
  --stop-datetime=name 
                      Stop reading the binlog at first event having a datetime
                      equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be
                      a date and time in the local time zone, in any format
                      accepted by the MySQL server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP
                      types, for example: 2004-12-25 11:25:56 (you should
                      probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly).
  --stop-never        Wait for more data from the server instead of stopping at
                      the end of the last log. Implicitly sets --to-last-log
                      but instead of stopping at the end of the last log it
                      continues to wait till the server disconnects.
  --stop-never-slave-server-id=# 
                      The server_id that is reported when connecting to a
                      source server when using --read-from-remote-server
                      --stop-never. This option is deprecated and will be
                      removed in a future version. Use connection-server-id
                      instead.
  --connection-server-id=# 
                      The server_id that will be reported when connecting to a
                      source server when using --read-from-remote-server. This
                      option cannot be used together with
                      stop-never-slave-server-id.
  --stop-position=#   Stop reading the binlog at position N. Applies to the
                      last binlog passed on the command line.
  -t, --to-last-log   Requires -R. Will not stop at the end of the requested
                      binlog but rather continue printing until the end of the
                      last binlog of the MySQL server. If you send the output
                      to the same MySQL server, that may lead to an endless
                      loop.
  -u, --user=name     Connect to the remote server as username.
  -v, --verbose       Reconstruct pseudo-SQL statements out of row events. -v
                      -v adds comments on column data types.
  -V, --version       Print version and exit.
  --open-files-limit=# 
                      Used to reserve file descriptors for use by this program.
  -c, --verify-binlog-checksum 
                      Verify checksum binlog events.
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. This value must be a multiple of 256.
  --skip-gtids        Do not preserve Global Transaction Identifiers; instead
                      make the server execute the transactions as if they were
                      new.
  --include-gtids=name 
                      Print events whose Global Transaction Identifiers were
                      provided.
  --exclude-gtids=name 
                      Print all events but those whose Global Transaction
                      Identifiers were provided.
  --print-table-metadata 
                      Print metadata stored in Table_map_log_event
  -C, --compress      Use compression in server/client protocol.
  --compression-algorithms=name 
                      Use compression algorithm in server/client protocol.
                      Valid values are any combination of
                      'zstd','zlib','uncompressed'.
  --zstd-compression-level=# 
                      Use this compression level in the client/server protocol,
                      in case --compression-algorithms=zstd. Valid range is
                      between 1 and 22, inclusive. Default is 3.
  --require-row-format 
                      Fail when printing an event that was not logged using row
                      format or other forbidden events like Load instructions
                      or the creation/deletion of temporary tables.

Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
C:\Windows\my.ini C:\Windows\my.cnf C:\my.ini C:\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MySQL-8.0\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MySQL-8.0\my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysqlbinlog client
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults        Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults           Don't read default options from any option file,
                        except for login file.
--defaults-file=#       Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=# Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=#
                        Also read groups with concat(group, suffix)
--login-path=#          Read this path from the login file.
