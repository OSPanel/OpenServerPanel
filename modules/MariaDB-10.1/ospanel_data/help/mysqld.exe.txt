mysqld.exe  Ver 10.1.48-MariaDB for Win64 on AMD64 (mariadb.org binary distribution)
Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Starts the MariaDB database server.

Usage: mysqld.exe [OPTIONS]
NT and Win32 specific options:
  --install                     Install the default service (NT).
  --install-manual              Install the default service started manually (NT).
  --install service_name        Install an optional service (NT).
  --install-manual service_name Install an optional service started manually (NT).
  --remove                      Remove the default service from the service list (NT).
  --remove service_name         Remove the service_name from the service list (NT).
  --enable-named-pipe           Only to be used for the default server (NT).
  --standalone                  Dummy option to start as a standalone server (NT).


Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
C:\Windows\my.ini C:\Windows\my.cnf C:\my.ini C:\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-10.1\data\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-10.1\data\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-10.1\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-10.1\my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysqld server mysqld-10.1 mariadb mariadb-10.1 client-server
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults          Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults             Don't read default options from any option file.
The following specify which files/extra groups are read (specified before remaining options):
--defaults-file=#         Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=#   Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=# Additionally read default groups with # appended as a suffix.

  --allow-suspicious-udfs 
                      Allows use of UDFs consisting of only one symbol xxx()
                      without corresponding xxx_init() or xxx_deinit(). That
                      also means that one can load any function from any
                      library, for example exit() from libc.so
  -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
                      will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
  --archive[=name]    Enable or disable ARCHIVE plugin. One of: ON, OFF, FORCE
                      (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).
  --aria[=name]       Enable or disable Aria plugin. One of: ON, OFF, FORCE
                      (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).
  --aria-block-size=# Block size to be used for Aria index pages.
  --aria-checkpoint-interval=# 
                      Interval between tries to do an automatic checkpoints. In
                      seconds; 0 means 'no automatic checkpoints' which makes
                      sense only for testing.
  --aria-checkpoint-log-activity=# 
                      Number of bytes that the transaction log has to grow
                      between checkpoints before a new checkpoint is written to
                      the log.
  --aria-encrypt-tables 
                      Encrypt tables (only for tables with ROW_FORMAT=PAGE
                      (default) and not FIXED/DYNAMIC)
  --aria-force-start-after-recovery-failures=# 
                      Number of consecutive log recovery failures after which
                      logs will be automatically deleted to cure the problem; 0
                      (the default) disables the feature.
  --aria-group-commit=name 
                      Specifies Aria group commit mode. Possible values are
                      "none" (no group commit), "hard" (with waiting to actual
                      commit), "soft" (no wait for commit (DANGEROUS!!!))
  --aria-group-commit-interval=# 
                      Interval between commite in microseconds (1/1000000c). 0
                      stands for no waiting for other threads to come and do a
                      commit in "hard" mode and no sync()/commit at all in
                      "soft" mode.  Option has only an effect if
                      aria_group_commit is used
  --aria-log-dir-path=name 
                      Path to the directory where to store transactional log
  --aria-log-file-size=# 
                      Limit for transaction log size
  --aria-log-purge-type=name 
                      Specifies how Aria transactional log will be purged. One
                      of: immediate, external, at_flush
  --aria-max-sort-file-size=# 
                      Don't use the fast sort index method to created index if
                      the temporary file would get bigger than this.
  --aria-page-checksum 
                      Maintain page checksums (can be overridden per table with
                      PAGE_CHECKSUM clause in CREATE TABLE)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-aria-page-checksum to disable.)
  --aria-pagecache-age-threshold=# 
                      This characterizes the number of hits a hot block has to
                      be untouched until it is considered aged enough to be
                      downgraded to a warm block. This specifies the percentage
                      ratio of that number of hits to the total number of
                      blocks in the page cache.
  --aria-pagecache-buffer-size=# 
                      The size of the buffer used for index blocks for Aria
                      tables. Increase this to get better index handling (for
                      all reads and multiple writes) to as much as you can
                      afford.
  --aria-pagecache-division-limit=# 
                      The minimum percentage of warm blocks in key cache
  --aria-pagecache-file-hash-size=# 
                      Number of hash buckets for open and changed files.  If
                      you have a lot of Aria files open you should increase
                      this for faster flush of changes. A good value is
                      probably 1/10 of number of possible open Aria files.
  --aria-recover[=name] 
                      Specifies how corrupted tables should be automatically
                      repaired. Any combination of: NORMAL, BACKUP, FORCE, 
                      QUICK, OFF
  --aria-repair-threads=# 
                      Number of threads to use when repairing Aria tables. The
                      value of 1 disables parallel repair.
  --aria-sort-buffer-size=# 
                      The buffer that is allocated when sorting the index when
                      doing a REPAIR or when creating indexes with CREATE INDEX
                      or ALTER TABLE.
  --aria-stats-method=name 
                      Specifies how Aria index statistics collection code
                      should treat NULLs. One of: nulls_unequal, nulls_equal, 
                      nulls_ignored
  --aria-sync-log-dir=name 
                      Controls syncing directory after log file growth and new
                      file creation. One of: NEVER, NEWFILE, ALWAYS
  --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
                      Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
  --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
                      Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
                      auto-increment-increment != 1
  --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
  --automatic-sp-privileges 
                      Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
  --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MariaDB can
                      have. This comes into play when the main MariaDB thread
                      gets very many connection requests in a very short time
                      (Automatically configured unless set explicitly)
  -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
                      resolved relative to this
  --big-tables        Old variable, which if set to 1, allows large result sets
                      by saving all temporary sets to disk, avoiding 'table
                      full' errors. No longer needed, as the server now handles
                      this automatically. sql_big_tables is a synonym.
  --bind-address=name IP address to bind to.
  --binlog-annotate-row-events 
                      Tells the master to annotate RBR events with the
                      statement that caused these events
  --binlog-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the transactional cache for updates to
                      transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
                      use transactions containing many statements, you can
                      increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-checksum=name 
                      Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
                      events in the binary log. One of: NONE, CRC32
  --binlog-commit-wait-count=# 
                      If non-zero, binlog write will wait at most
                      binlog_commit_wait_usec microseconds for at least this
                      many commits to queue up for group commit to the binlog.
                      This can reduce I/O on the binlog and provide increased
                      opportunity for parallel apply on the slave, but too high
                      a value will decrease commit throughput.
  --binlog-commit-wait-usec=# 
                      Maximum time, in microseconds, to wait for more commits
                      to queue up for binlog group commit. Only takes effect if
                      the value of binlog_commit_wait_count is non-zero.
  --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
                      Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
                      statement format to be written directly to binary log.
                      Before using this option make sure that there are no
                      dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
                      tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
                      SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
                      from the master.
  --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
                      database, and exclude all others not explicitly
                      mentioned.
  --binlog-format=name 
                      What form of binary logging the master will use: either
                      ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
                      statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
                      statement-based binary logging except for those
                      statements where only row-based is correct: those which
                      involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
                      function; for those, row-based binary logging is
                      automatically used.
  --binlog-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the master that updates to the given database
                      should not be logged to the binary log.
  --binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling 
                      Run fast part of group commit in a single thread, to
                      optimize kernel thread scheduling. On by default. Disable
                      to run each transaction in group commit in its own
                      thread, which can be slower at very high concurrency.
                      This option is mostly for testing one algorithm versus
                      the other, and it should not normally be necessary to
                      change it.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling to disable.)
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
  --binlog-row-image=name 
                      Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
                      'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
                      columns in the before and after image are logged.
                      'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
                      whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
                      not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
                      equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
                      the table) is logged in the before image, and only
                      changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
                      FULL).
  --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the statement cache for updates to
                      non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
                      often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
                      can increase this to get more performance.
  --blackhole[=name]  Enable or disable BLACKHOLE plugin. One of: ON, OFF,
                      FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).
  --bootstrap         Used by mysql installation scripts.
  --bulk-insert-buffer-size=# 
                      Size of tree cache used in bulk insert optimisation. Note
                      that this is a limit per thread!
  --changed-page-bitmaps[=name] 
                      Enable or disable CHANGED_PAGE_BITMAPS plugin. One of:
                      ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).
  --character-set-client-handshake 
                      Don't ignore client side character set value sent during
                      handshake.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-character-set-client-handshake to disable.)
  --character-set-filesystem=name 
                      Set the filesystem character set.
  -C, --character-set-server=name 
                      Set the default character set.
  --character-sets-dir=name 
                      Directory where character sets are
  -r, --chroot=name   Chroot mysqld daemon during startup.

                      Set the default collation.
  --completion-type=name 
                      The transaction completion type. One of: NO_CHAIN, CHAIN,
                      RELEASE
  --concurrent-insert[=name] 
                      Use concurrent insert with MyISAM. One of: NEVER, AUTO, 
                      ALWAYS
  --connect-timeout=# The number of seconds the mysqld server is waiting for a
                      connect packet before responding with 'Bad handshake'
  --console           Write error output on screen; don't remove the console
                      window on windows.
  --core-file         Write core on errors.
  -h, --datadir=name  Path to the database root directory
  --date-format=name  The DATE format (ignored)

                      DELAY_KEY_WRITE. If set to ON, the default, any DELAY KEY
                      WRITEs are honored. The key buffer is then flushed only
                      when the table closes, speeding up writes. MyISAM tables
                      should be automatically checked upon startup in this
                      case, and --external locking should not be used, as it
                      can lead to index corruption. If set to OFF, DELAY KEY
                      WRITEs are ignored, while if set to ALL, all new opened
                      tables are treated as if created with DELAY KEY WRITEs
                      enabled.
  --delayed-insert-limit=# 
                      After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
                      DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
                      statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
                      before continuing.
  --delayed-insert-timeout=# 
                      How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
                      statements before terminating

                      What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for
                      handling INSERT DELAYED. If the queue becomes full, any
                      client that does INSERT DELAYED will wait until there is
                      room in the queue again

                      cache, etc)
  --enforce-storage-engine=name 
                      Force the use of a storage engine for new tables
  --event-scheduler[=name] 
                      Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
                      and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
                      deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
  --expensive-subquery-limit=# 
                      The maximum number of rows a subquery may examine in
                      order to be executed during optimization and used for
                      constant optimization
  --expire-logs-days=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      expire_logs_days days; possible purges happen at startup
                      and at binary log rotation
  --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
                      This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
                      columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
                      option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
                      DEFAULT clauses. The old behavior is deprecated.
  --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
                      With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
                      (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
                      Disable with --skip-external-locking.
  --extra-max-connections=# 
                      The number of connections on extra-port
  --extra-port=#      Extra port number to use for tcp connections in a
                      one-thread-per-connection manner. 0 means don't use
                      another port

                      FULLTEXT index. Note: FULLTEXT indexes must be rebuilt
                      after changing this variable
  --ft-min-word-len=# The minimum length of the word to be included in a
                      FULLTEXT index. Note: FULLTEXT indexes must be rebuilt

  --ft-query-expansion-limit=# 
                      Number of best matches to use for query expansion
  --ft-stopword-file=name 
                      Use stopwords from this file instead of built-in list

  --general-log       Log connections and queries to a table or log file.
                      Defaults logging to a file 'hostname'.log or a table
                      mysql.general_logif --log-output=TABLE is used.
  --general-log-file=name 
                      Log connections and queries to given file
  --getopt-prefix-matching 
                      Recognize command-line options by their unambiguos
                      prefixes.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-getopt-prefix-matching to disable.)
  --group-concat-max-len=# 
                      The maximum length of the result of function 
                      GROUP_CONCAT()
  --gtid-domain-id=#  Used with global transaction ID to identify logically
                      independent replication streams. When events can
                      propagate through multiple parallel paths (for example
                      multiple masters), each independent source server must
                      use a distinct domain_id. For simple tree-shaped
                      replication topologies, it can be left at its default, 0.
  --gtid-ignore-duplicates 
                      When set, different master connections in multi-source
                      replication are allowed to receive and process event
                      groups with the same GTID (when using GTID mode). Only
                      one will be applied, any others will be ignored. Within a
                      given replication domain, just the sequence number will
                      be used to decide whether a given GTID has been already
                      applied; this means it is the responsibility of the user
                      to ensure that GTID sequence numbers are strictly
                      increasing.
  --gtid-strict-mode  Enforce strict seq_no ordering of events in the binary
                      log. Slave stops with an error if it encounters an event
                      that would cause it to generate an out-of-order binlog if
                      executed.

  --ignore-db-dirs=name 
                      Specifies a directory to add to the ignore list when
                      collecting database names from the datadir. Put a blank
                      argument to reset the list accumulated so far.

                      the SQL thread starts
  --innodb[=name]     Enable or disable InnoDB plugin. One of: ON, OFF, FORCE
                      (don't start if the plugin fails to load),

                      be uninstalled).
  --innodb-adaptive-flushing 
                      Attempt flushing dirty pages to avoid IO bursts at
                      checkpoints.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-adaptive-flushing to disable.)
  --innodb-adaptive-flushing-lwm=# 
                      Percentage of log capacity below which no adaptive
                      flushing happens.
  --innodb-adaptive-hash-index 
                      Enable InnoDB adaptive hash index (enabled by default). 
                      Disable with --skip-innodb-adaptive-hash-index.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-adaptive-hash-index to disable.)

                      releases, together with the option innodb_use_sys_malloc
                      and with the InnoDB's internal memory allocator. Size of
                      a memory pool InnoDB uses to store data dictionary

                      every 10% of number of buffer pool pages are dumped.
                      Default is 0 (only start and end status is printed).

                      The default ROW FORMAT for all innodb tables created
                      without explicit ROW_FORMAT. Possible values are
                      REDUNDANT, COMPACT, and DYNAMIC. The ROW_FORMAT value
                      COMPRESSED is not allowed. One of: redundant, compact, 
                      dynamic
  --innodb-defragment Enable/disable InnoDB defragmentation (default FALSE).
                      When set to FALSE, all existing defragmentation will be
                      paused. And new defragmentation command will fail.Paused

                      0.7 won't make much sense.This variable, together with
                      innodb_defragment_fill_factor_n_recs, is introduced so
                      defragmentation won't pack the page too full and cause
                      page split on the next insert on every page. The variable
                      indicating more defragmentation gain is the one

  --innodb-defragment-fill-factor-n-recs=# 
                      How many records of space defragmentation should leave on
                      the page. This variable, together with
                      innodb_defragment_fill_factor, is introduced so
                      defragmentation won't pack the page too full and cause
                      page split on the next insert on every page. The variable
                      indicating more defragmentation gain is the one

                      defragmentation thread can request X_LOCK on an index.
                      Defragmentation thread will check whether
                      1/defragment_frequency (s) has passed since it worked on
                      this index last time, and put the index back to the queue
                      if not enough time has passed. The actual frequency can
                      only be lower than this given number.
  --innodb-defragment-n-pages=# 
                      Number of pages considered at once when merging multiple

                      In the transaction after enabled, UPDATE, INSERT and
                      DELETE only move the cursor to the records and do nothing
                      other operations (no changes, no ibuf, no undo, no
                      transaction log) in the transaction. This is to cause
                      replication prefetch IO. ATTENTION: the transaction
                      started after enabled is affected.
  --innodb-fast-shutdown[=#] 
                      Speeds up the shutdown process of the InnoDB storage
                      engine. Possible values are 0, 1 (faster) or 2 (fastest -
                      crash-like).
  --innodb-fatal-semaphore-wait-threshold=# 
                      Maximum number of seconds that semaphore times out in
                      InnoDB.
  --innodb-file-format=name

                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-file-format-check to disable.)
  --innodb-file-format-max[=name] 
                      The highest file format in the tablespace.
  --innodb-file-io-threads=# 
                      Number of file I/O threads in InnoDB.
  --innodb-file-per-table 
                      Stores each InnoDB table to an .ibd file in the database
                      dir.

  --innodb-flush-log-at-timeout[=#] 
                      Write and flush logs every (n) second.
  --innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit[=#] 
                      Controls the durability/speed trade-off for commits. Set
                      to 0 (write and flush redo log to disk only once per
                      second), 1 (flush to disk at each commit), 2 (write to
                      log at commit but flush to disk only once per second) or
                      3 (flush to disk at prepare and at commit, slower and
                      usually redundant). 1 and 3 guarantees that after a
                      crash, committed transactions will not be lost and will
                      be consistent with the binlog and other transactional
                      engines. 2 can get inconsistent and lose transactions if
                      there is a power failure or kernel crash but not if
                      mysqld crashes. 0 has no guarantees in case of crash. 0
                      and 2 can be faster than 1 or 3.

                      (flush contiguous neighbors from buffer pool) or 2 (flush
                      neighbors from buffer pool), when flushing a block
  --innodb-flushing-avg-loops=# 
                      Number of iterations over which the background flushing

                      Enable or disable INNODB_TABLESPACES_ENCRYPTION plugin.
                      One of: ON, OFF, FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails
                      to load), FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the
                      plugin can not be uninstalled).
  --innodb-tablespaces-scrubbing[=name] 
                      Enable or disable INNODB_TABLESPACES_SCRUBBING plugin.

                      Helps in performance tuning in heavily concurrent
                      environments. Sets the maximum number of threads allowed
                      inside InnoDB. Value 0 will disable the thread

                      FORCE (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).

                      Number of undo tablespaces to use. 
  --innodb-use-atomic-writes 
                      Prevent partial page writes, via atomic writes (beta).
                      The option is used to prevent partial writes in case of a
                      crash/poweroff, as faster alternative to doublewrite
                      buffer. Currently this option works only on Linux only
                      with FusionIO device, and directFS filesystem.

                      Preallocate files fast, using operating system
                      functionality. On POSIX systems, posix_fallocate system
                      call is used.

                      Use global innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit value.
                      (default: ON).
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-use-global-flush-log-at-trx-commit to disable.)

  --innodb-use-native-aio 
                      Use native AIO if supported on this platform.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-use-native-aio to disable.)
  --innodb-use-stacktrace 
                      Print stacktrace on long semaphore wait (off by default
                      supported only on linux)
  --innodb-use-sys-malloc 
                      DEPRECATED. This option may be removed in future
                      releases, together with the InnoDB's internal memory
                      allocator. Use OS memory allocator instead of InnoDB's
                      internal memory allocator
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-use-sys-malloc to disable.)
  --innodb-use-trim   Use trim. Default FALSE.
  --innodb-write-io-threads=# 
                      Number of background write I/O threads in InnoDB.
  --interactive-timeout=# 
                      The number of seconds the server waits for activity on an
                      interactive connection before closing it
  --join-buffer-size=# 
                      The size of the buffer that is used for joins
  --join-buffer-space-limit=# 
                      The limit of the space for all join buffers used by a
                      query
  --join-cache-level=# 
                      Controls what join operations can be executed with join
                      buffers. Odd numbers are used for plain join buffers
                      while even numbers are used for linked buffers
  --keep-files-on-create 
                      Don't overwrite stale .MYD and .MYI even if no directory
                      is specified
  --key-buffer-size=# The size of the buffer used for index blocks for MyISAM
                      tables. Increase this to get better index handling (for
                      all reads and multiple writes) to as much as you can
                      afford
  --key-cache-age-threshold=# 
                      This characterizes the number of hits a hot block has to
                      be untouched until it is considered aged enough to be
                      downgraded to a warm block. This specifies the percentage
                      ratio of that number of hits to the total number of
                      blocks in key cache
  --key-cache-block-size=# 
                      The default size of key cache blocks

  --key-cache-file-hash-size=# 
                      Number of hash buckets for open and changed files.  If
                      you have a lot of MyISAM files open you should increase
                      this for faster flush of changes. A good value is
                      probably 1/10 of number of possible open MyISAM files.
  --key-cache-segments=# 
                      The number of segments in a key cache
  -L, --language=name Client error messages in given language. May be given as

                      Set the language used for the month names and the days of
                      the week.
  --local-infile      Enable LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-local-infile to disable.)
  --lock-wait-timeout=# 
                      Timeout in seconds to wait for a lock before returning an
                      error.
  --log-basename=name Basename for all log files and the .pid file. This sets
                      all log file names at once (in 'datadir') and is normally
                      the only option you need for specifying log files. Sets
                      names for --log-bin, --log-bin-index, --relay-log,
                      --relay-log-index, --general-log-file,
                      --log-slow-query-log-file, --log-error-file, and
                      --pid-file
  --log-bin[=name]    Log update queries in binary format. Optional argument
                      should be name for binary log. If not given
                      'datadir'/'log-basename'-bin or 'datadir'/mysql-bin will
                      be used (the later if --log-basename is not specified).
                      We strongly recommend to use either --log-basename or
                      specify a filename to ensure that replication doesn't
                      stop if the real hostname of the computer changes.
  --log-bin-index=name 
                      File that holds the names for last binary log files.
  --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
                      If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
                      used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
                      allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
                      if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
                      logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
                      ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
                      do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
                      can safely set this to TRUE
  --log-error[=name]  Log errors to file (instead of stdout).  If file name is
                      not specified then 'datadir'/'log-basename'.err or the
                      'pid-file' path with extension .err is used
  --log-isam[=name]   Log all MyISAM changes to file.

  --log-short-format  Don't log extra information to update and slow-query
                      logs.
  --log-slave-updates Tells the slave to log the updates from the slave thread
                      to the binary log. You will need to turn it on if you

  --log-slow-admin-statements 
                      Log slow OPTIMIZE, ANALYZE, ALTER and other
                      administrative statements to the slow log if it is open.
  --log-slow-filter=name 
                      Log only certain types of queries. Any combination of:

                      query_cache, query_cache_miss, tmp_table, 
                      tmp_table_on_disk
  --log-slow-rate-limit=# 
                      Write to slow log every #th slow query. Set to 1 to log
                      everything. Increase it to reduce the size of the slow or
                      the performance impact of slow logging
  --log-slow-slave-statements 
                      Log slow statements executed by slave thread to the slow
                      log if it is open.
  --log-slow-verbosity=name 
                      Verbosity level for the slow log. Any combination of: 
                      innodb, query_plan, explain
  --log-tc=name       Path to transaction coordinator log (used for
                      transactions that affect more than one storage engine,

                      See also --old-mode
  --old-alter-table   Use old, non-optimized alter table
  --old-mode=name     Used to emulate old behavior from earlier MariaDB or
                      MySQL versions. Any combination of: 
                      NO_DUP_KEY_WARNINGS_WITH_IGNORE, NO_PROGRESS_INFO, 
                      ZERO_DATE_TIME_CAST
  --old-passwords     Use old password encryption method (needed for 4.0 and

  --old-style-user-limits 
                      Enable old-style user limits (before 5.0.3, user

  --open-files-limit=# 
                      If this is not 0, then mysqld will use this value to
                      reserve file descriptors to use with setrlimit(). If this
                      value is 0 then mysqld will reserve max_connections*5 or
                      max_connections + table_cache*2 (whichever is larger)
                      number of file descriptors
  --optimizer-prune-level=# 
                      Controls the heuristic(s) applied during query
                      optimization to prune less-promising partial plans from
                      the optimizer search space. Meaning: 0 - do not apply any
                      heuristic, thus perform exhaustive search; 1 - prune
                      plans based on number of retrieved rows
  --optimizer-search-depth=# 
                      Maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.
                      Values larger than the number of relations in a query
                      result in better query plans, but take longer to compile
                      a query. Values smaller than the number of tables in a
                      relation result in faster optimization, but may produce
                      very bad query plans. If set to 0, the system will
                      automatically pick a reasonable value; if set to 63, the
                      optimizer will switch to the original find_best search.
                      NOTE: The value 63 and its associated behaviour is
                      deprecated.

                      Fine-tune the optimizer behavior. Takes a comma-separated
                      list of option=value pairs, where value is on, off, or
                      default, and options are: index_merge, index_merge_union,
                      index_merge_sort_union, index_merge_intersection, 
                      index_merge_sort_intersection, engine_condition_pushdown,

                      extended_keys, exists_to_in, orderby_uses_equalities
  --optimizer-use-condition-selectivity=# 
                      Controls selectivity of which conditions the optimizer
                      takes into account to calculate cardinality of a partial
                      join when it searches for the best execution plan
                      Meaning: 1 - use selectivity of index backed range
                      conditions to calculate the cardinality of a partial join
                      if the last joined table is accessed by full table scan
                      or an index scan, 2 - use selectivity of index backed
                      range conditions to calculate the cardinality of a
                      partial join in any case, 3 - additionally always use
                      selectivity of range conditions that are not backed by
                      any index to calculate the cardinality of a partial join,
                      4 - use histograms to calculate selectivity of range
                      conditions that are not backed by any index to calculate
                      the cardinality of a partial join.5 - additionally use
                      selectivity of certain non-range predicates calculated on
                      record samples
  --partition[=name]  Enable or disable partition plugin. One of: ON, OFF,

  --relay-log-space-limit=# 
                      Maximum space to use for all relay logs
  --replicate-annotate-row-events 
                      Tells the slave to write annotate rows events received
                      from the master to its own binary log. Ignored if
                      log_slave_updates is not set
  --replicate-do-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified database. To specify more than one database,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-events-marked-for-skip=name 
                      Whether the slave should replicate events that were
                      created with @@skip_replication=1 on the master. Default
                      REPLICATE (no events are skipped). Other values are
                      FILTER_ON_SLAVE (events will be sent by the master but
                      ignored by the slave) and FILTER_ON_MASTER (events marked
                      with @@skip_replication=1 will be filtered on the master
                      and never be sent to the slave).
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      This option will not work if you use cross database
                      updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
                      sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-ignore-db.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
  --replicate-same-server-id 
                      In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
                      our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
                      loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
                      --log-slave-updates is used.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
                      that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
                      than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
                      to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
                      table names start with bar.
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
                      SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
                      slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
                      not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
                      the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
                      NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
                      for connecting to the slave from the master or other
                      hosts
  --report-password=name 
                      The account password of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If
                      not sure, leave this option unset
  --report-user=name  The account user name of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --rowid-merge-buff-size=# 
                      The size of the buffers used [NOT] IN evaluation via
                      partial matching
  --safe-mode         Skip some optimize stages (for testing). Deprecated.
  --safe-user-create  Don't allow new user creation by the user who has no
                      write privileges to the mysql.user table.
  --secure-auth       Disallow authentication for accounts that have old
                      (pre-4.1) passwords
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-secure-auth to disable.)
  --secure-file-priv=name 
                      Limit LOAD DATA, SELECT ... OUTFILE, and LOAD_FILE() to
                      files within specified directory
  --sequence[=name]   Enable or disable SEQUENCE plugin. One of: ON, OFF, FORCE
                      (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).
  --server-id=#       Uniquely identifies the server instance in the community
                      of replication partners
  --shared-memory     Enable the shared memory
  --shared-memory-base-name=name 
                      Base name of shared memory
  --show-slave-auth-info 
                      Show user and password in SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on this
                      master.
  --silent-startup    Don't print [Note] to the error log during startup.
  --skip-bdb          Deprecated option; Exist only for compatibility with old
                      my.cnf files
  --skip-grant-tables Start without grant tables. This gives all users FULL
                      ACCESS to all tables.
  --skip-host-cache   Don't cache host names.
  --skip-name-resolve Don't resolve hostnames. All hostnames are IP's or
                      'localhost'.
  --skip-networking   Don't allow connection with TCP/IP
  --skip-show-database 
                      Don't allow 'SHOW DATABASE' commands
  --skip-slave-start  If set, slave is not autostarted.
  --slave-compressed-protocol 
                      Use compression on master/slave protocol
  --slave-ddl-exec-mode=name 
                      How replication events should be executed. Legal values
                      are STRICT and IDEMPOTENT (default). In IDEMPOTENT mode,
                      replication will not stop for DDL operations that are
                      idempotent. This means that CREATE TABLE is treated as
                      CREATE TABLE OR REPLACE and DROP TABLE is treated as DROP
                      TABLE IF EXISTS.
  --slave-domain-parallel-threads=# 
                      Maximum number of parallel threads to use on slave for
                      events in a single replication domain. When using
                      multiple domains, this can be used to limit a single
                      domain from grabbing all threads and thus stalling other
                      domains. The default of 0 means to allow a domain to grab
                      as many threads as it wants, up to the value of
                      slave_parallel_threads.
  --slave-exec-mode=name 
                      How replication events should be executed. Legal values
                      are STRICT (default) and IDEMPOTENT. In IDEMPOTENT mode,
                      replication will not stop for operations that are
                      idempotent. For example, in row based replication
                      attempts to delete rows that doesn't exist will be
                      ignored. In STRICT mode, replication will stop on any
                      unexpected difference between the master and the slave.
  --slave-load-tmpdir=name 
                      The location where the slave should put its temporary
                      files when replicating a LOAD DATA INFILE command
  --slave-max-allowed-packet=# 
                      The maximum packet length to sent successfully from the
                      master to slave.
  --slave-net-timeout=# 
                      Number of seconds to wait for more data from any
                      master/slave connection before aborting the read
  --slave-parallel-max-queued=# 
                      Limit on how much memory SQL threads should use per
                      parallel replication thread when reading ahead in the
                      relay log looking for opportunities for parallel
                      replication. Only used when --slave-parallel-threads > 0.
  --slave-parallel-mode=name 
                      Controls what transactions are applied in parallel when
                      using --slave-parallel-threads. Possible values:
                      "optimistic" tries to apply most transactional DML in
                      parallel, and handles any conflicts with rollback and
                      retry. "conservative" limits parallelism in an effort to
                      avoid any conflicts. "aggressive" tries to maximise the
                      parallelism, possibly at the cost of increased conflict
                      rate. "minimal" only parallelizes the commit steps of
                      transactions. "none" disables parallel apply completely.
  --slave-parallel-threads=# 
                      If non-zero, number of threads to spawn to apply in
                      parallel events on the slave that were group-committed on
                      the master or were logged with GTID in different
                      replication domains. Note that these threads are in
                      addition to the IO and SQL threads, which are always
                      created by a replication slave
  --slave-run-triggers-for-rbr=name 
                      Modes for how triggers in row-base replication on slave
                      side will be executed. Legal values are NO (default), YES
                      and LOGGING. NO means that trigger for RBR will not be
                      running on slave. YES and LOGGING means that triggers
                      will be running on slave, if there was not triggers
                      running on the master for the statement. LOGGING also
                      means results of that the executed triggers work will be
                      written to the binlog.
  --slave-skip-errors=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to continue replication when a
                      query event returns an error from the provided list
  --slave-sql-verify-checksum 
                      Force checksum verification of replication events after
                      reading them from relay log. Note: Events are always
                      checksum-verified by slave on receiving them from the
                      network before writing them to the relay log
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-slave-sql-verify-checksum to disable.)
  --slave-transaction-retries=# 
                      Number of times the slave SQL thread will retry a
                      transaction in case it failed with a deadlock or elapsed
                      lock wait timeout, before giving up and stopping
  --slave-type-conversions=name 
                      Set of slave type conversions that are enabled. If the
                      variable is empty, no conversions are allowed and it is
                      expected that the types match exactly. Any combination
                      of: ALL_LOSSY, ALL_NON_LOSSY
  --slow-launch-time=# 
                      If creating the thread takes longer than this value (in
                      seconds), the Slow_launch_threads counter will be
                      incremented
  --slow-query-log    Log slow queries to a table or log file. Defaults logging
                      to a file 'hostname'-slow.log or a table mysql.slow_log
                      if --log-output=TABLE is used. Must be enabled to
                      activate other slow log options.
  --slow-query-log-file=name 
                      Log slow queries to given log file. Defaults logging to
                      'hostname'-slow.log. Must be enabled to activate other
                      slow log options
  --slow-start-timeout=# 
                      Maximum number of milliseconds that the service control
                      manager should wait before trying to kill the windows
                      service during startup(Default: 15000).
  --socket=name       Socket file to use for connection
  --sort-buffer-size=# 
                      Each thread that needs to do a sort allocates a buffer of
                      this size
  --sql-mode=name     Sets the sql mode. Any combination of: REAL_AS_FLOAT,
