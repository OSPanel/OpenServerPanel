-p <num>      TCP port number to listen on (default: 11211)
-U <num>      UDP port number to listen on (default: 0, off)
-s <file>     unix socket path to listen on (disables network support)
-a <mask>     access mask for unix socket, in octal (default 0700)
-l <ip_addr>  interface to listen on, default is INDRR_ANY
-d start          tell memcached to start
-d restart        tell running memcached to do a graceful restart
-d stop|shutdown  tell running memcached to shutdown
-d install        install memcached service
-d uninstall      uninstall memcached service
-r            maximize core file limit
-u <username> assume identity of <username> (only when run as root)
-m <num>      max memory to use for items in megabytes, default is 64 MB
-M            return error on memory exhausted (rather than removing items)

-k            lock down all paged memory.  Note that there is a
              limit on how much memory you may lock.  Trying to
              allocate more than that would fail, so be sure you
              set the limit correctly for the user you started
              the daemon with (not for -u <username> user;
              under sh this is done with 'ulimit -S -l NUM_KB').
