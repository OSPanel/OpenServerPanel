Usage: mysqlbinlog.exe [options] log-files
  -?, --help          Display this help and exit.
  --base64-output[=name] 
                      Determine when the output statements should be
                      base64-encoded BINLOG statements: 'never' disables it and
                      works only for binlogs without row-based events;
                      'decode-rows' decodes row events into commented SQL
                      statements if the --verbose option is also given; 'auto'
                      prints base64 only when necessary (i.e., for row-based
                      events and format description events); 'always' prints
                      base64 whenever possible. 'always' is for debugging only
                      and should not be used in a production system. If this
                      argument is not given, the default is 'auto'; if it is
                      given with no argument, 'always' is used.
  --character-sets-dir=name 
                      Directory for character set files.
  -d, --database=name List entries for just this database (local log only).
  --debug-check       Check memory and open file usage at exit .
  --debug-info        Print some debug info at exit.
  -D, --disable-log-bin 
                      Disable binary log. This is useful, if you enabled
                      --to-last-log and are sending the output to the same
                      MySQL server. This way you could avoid an endless loop.
                      You would also like to use it when restoring after a
                      crash to avoid duplication of the statements you already
                      have. NOTE: you will need a SUPER privilege to use this
                      option.
  -F, --force-if-open Force if binlog was not closed properly.
  -f, --force-read    Force reading unknown binlog events.
  -H, --hexdump       Augment output with hexadecimal and ASCII event dump.
  -h, --host=name     Get the binlog from server.
  -l, --local-load=name 
                      Prepare local temporary files for LOAD DATA INFILE in the
                      specified directory.
  -o, --offset=#      Skip the first N entries.
  -p, --password[=name] 
                      Password to connect to remote server.
  -P, --port=#        Port number to use for connection or 0 for default to, in
                      order of preference, my.cnf, $MYSQL_TCP_PORT,
                      /etc/services, built-in default (3306).
  --position=#        Deprecated. Use --start-position instead.
  --protocol=name     The protocol to use for connection (tcp, socket, pipe,
                      memory).
  -R, --read-from-remote-server 
                      Read binary logs from a MySQL server.
  -r, --result-file=name 
                      Direct output to a given file.
  --server-id=#       Extract only binlog entries created by the server having
                      the given id.
  --set-charset=name  Add 'SET NAMES character_set' to the output.
  --shared-memory-base-name=name 
                      Base name of shared memory.
  -s, --short-form    Just show regular queries: no extra info and no row-based
                      events. This is for testing only, and should not be used
                      in production systems. If you want to suppress
                      base64-output, consider using --base64-output=never
                      instead.
  -S, --socket=name   The socket file to use for connection.
  --start-datetime=name 
                      Start reading the binlog at first event having a datetime
                      equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be
                      a date and time in the local time zone, in any format
                      accepted by the MySQL server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP
                      types, for example: 2004-12-25 11:25:56 (you should
                      probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly).
  -j, --start-position=# 
                      Start reading the binlog at position N. Applies to the
                      first binlog passed on the command line.
  --stop-datetime=name 
                      Stop reading the binlog at first event having a datetime
                      equal or posterior to the argument; the argument must be
                      a date and time in the local time zone, in any format
                      accepted by the MySQL server for DATETIME and TIMESTAMP
                      types, for example: 2004-12-25 11:25:56 (you should
                      probably use quotes for your shell to set it properly).
  --stop-position=#   Stop reading the binlog at position N. Applies to the
                      last binlog passed on the command line.
  -t, --to-last-log   Requires -R. Will not stop at the end of the requested
                      binlog but rather continue printing until the end of the
                      last binlog of the MySQL server. If you send the output
                      to the same MySQL server, that may lead to an endless
                      loop.
  -u, --user=name     Connect to the remote server as username.
  -v, --verbose       Reconstruct SQL statements out of row events. -v -v adds
                      comments on column data types.
  -V, --version       Print version and exit.
  --open_files_limit=# 
                      Used to reserve file descriptors for use by this program.
