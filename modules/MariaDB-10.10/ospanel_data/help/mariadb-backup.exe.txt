Usage: mariadb-backup.exe [--defaults-file=#] [--backup | --prepare | --copy-back | --move-back] [OPTIONS]

Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
C:\Windows\my.ini C:\Windows\my.cnf C:\my.ini C:\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-10.10\data\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-10.10\data\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-10.10\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-10.10\my.cnf 
The following groups are read: xtrabackup mariabackup mariadb-backup mysqld server mysqld-10.10 mariadb mariadb-10.10 mariadbd mariadbd-10.10 client-server
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults          Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults             Don't read default options from any option file.
The following specify which files/extra groups are read (specified before remaining options):
--defaults-file=#         Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=#   Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=# Additionally read default groups with # appended as a suffix.
  -V, --verbose       display verbose output
  -v, --version       print version information
  --target-dir=name   destination directory
  --backup            take backup to target-dir
  --prepare           prepare a backup for starting mysql server on the backup.
  --export            create files to import to another database when prepare.
  --print-param       print parameter of mysqld needed for copyback.
  --use-memory=#      The value is used in place of innodb_buffer_pool_size.
                      This option is only relevant when the --prepare option is
                      specified.
  --throttle=#        limit count of IO operations (pairs of read&write) per
                      second to IOS values (for '--backup')
  --log[=name]        Ignored option for MySQL option compatibility
  --log-copy-interval=# 
                      time interval between checks done by log copying thread
                      in milliseconds (default is 1 second).
  --extra-lsndir=name (for --backup): save an extra copy of the
                      xtrabackup_checkpoints file in this directory.
  --incremental-lsn=name 
                      (for --backup): copy only .ibd pages newer than specified
                      LSN 'high:low'. ##ATTENTION##: If a wrong LSN value is
                      specified, it is impossible to diagnose this, causing the
                      backup to be unusable. Be careful!
  --incremental-basedir=name 
                      (for --backup): copy only .ibd pages newer than backup at
                      specified directory.
  --incremental-dir=name 
                      (for --prepare): apply .delta files and logfile in the
                      specified directory.
  --tables=name       filtering by regexp for table names.
  --tables-file=name  filtering by list of the exact database.table name in the
                      file.
  --databases=name    filtering by list of databases.
  --databases-file=name 
                      filtering by list of databases in the file.
  --tables-exclude=name 
                      filtering by regexp for table names. Operates the same
                      way as --tables, but matched names are excluded from
                      backup. Note that this option has a higher priority than
                      --tables.
  --databases-exclude=name 
                      Excluding databases based on name, Operates the same way
                      as --databases, but matched names are excluded from
                      backup. Note that this option has a higher priority than
                      --databases.
  --stream=name       Stream all backup files to the standard output in the
                      specified format.Supported format is 'mbstream' or
                      'xbstream'.
  --compress[=name]   Compress individual backup files using the specified
                      compression algorithm. Currently the only supported
                      algorithm is 'quicklz'. It is also the default algorithm,
                      i.e. the one used when --compress is used without an
                      argument.
  --compress-threads=# 
                      Number of threads for parallel data compression. The
                      default value is 1.
  --compress-chunk-size=# 
                      Size of working buffer(s) for compression threads in
                      bytes. The default value is 64K.
  --incremental-force-scan 
                      Perform a full-scan incremental backup even in the
                      presence of changed page bitmap data
  --close-files       do not keep files opened. Use at your own risk.
  --core-file         Write core on fatal signals
  --copy-back         Copy all the files in a previously made backup from the
                      backup directory to their original locations.
  --move-back         Move all the files in a previously made backup from the
                      backup directory to the actual datadir location. Use with
                      caution, as it removes backup files.
  --galera-info       This options creates the xtrabackup_galera_info file
                      which contains the local node state at the time of the
                      backup. Option should be used when performing the backup
                      of MariaDB Galera Cluster. Has no effect when backup
                      locks are used to create the backup.
  --slave-info        This option is useful when backing up a replication slave
                      server. It prints the binary log position and name of the
                      master server. It also writes this information to the
                      "xtrabackup_slave_info" file as a "CHANGE MASTER"
                      command. A new slave for this master can be set up by
                      starting a slave server on this backup and issuing a
                      "CHANGE MASTER" command with the binary log position
                      saved in the "xtrabackup_slave_info" file.
  --no-lock           Use this option to disable table lock with "FLUSH TABLES
                      WITH READ LOCK". Use it only if ALL your tables are
                      InnoDB and you DO NOT CARE about the binary log position
                      of the backup. This option shouldn't be used if there are
                      any DDL statements being executed or if any updates are
                      happening on non-InnoDB tables (this includes the system
                      MyISAM tables in the mysql database), otherwise it could
                      lead to an inconsistent backup. If you are considering to
                      use --no-lock because your backups are failing to acquire
                      the lock, this could be because of incoming replication
                      events preventing the lock from succeeding. Please try
                      using --safe-slave-backup to momentarily stop the
                      replication slave thread, this may help the backup to
                      succeed and you then don't need to resort to using this
                      option.
  --safe-slave-backup Stop slave SQL thread and wait to start backup until
                      Slave_open_temp_tables in "SHOW STATUS" is zero. If there
                      are no open temporary tables, the backup will take place,
                      otherwise the SQL thread will be started and stopped
                      until there are no open temporary tables. The backup will
                      fail if Slave_open_temp_tables does not become zero after
                      --safe-slave-backup-timeout seconds. The slave SQL thread
                      will be restarted when the backup finishes.
  --rsync             Uses the rsync utility to optimize local file transfers.
                      When this option is specified, mariadb-backup uses rsync
                      to copy all non-InnoDB files instead of spawning a
                      separate cp for each file, which can be much faster for
                      servers with a large number of databases or tables.  This
                      option cannot be used together with --stream.
  --force-non-empty-directories 
                      This option, when specified, makes --copy-back or
                      --move-back transfer files to non-empty directories. Note
                      that no existing files will be overwritten. If
                      --copy-back or --move-back has to copy a file from the
                      backup directory which already exists in the destination
                      directory, it will still fail with an error.
  --no-version-check  This option disables the version check which is enabled
                      by the --version-check option.
  --no-backup-locks   This option controls if backup locks should be used
                      instead of FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK on the backup
                      stage. The option has no effect when backup locks are not
                      supported by the server. This option is enabled by
                      default, disable with --no-backup-locks.
  --decompress        Decompresses all files with the .qp extension in a backup
                      previously made with the --compress option.
  -u, --user=name     This option specifies the MySQL username used when
                      connecting to the server, if that's not the current user.
                      The option accepts a string argument. See mysql --help
                      for details.
  -H, --host=name     This option specifies the host to use when connecting to
                      the database server with TCP/IP.  The option accepts a
                      string argument. See mysql --help for details.
  -P, --port=#        This option specifies the port to use when connecting to
                      the database server with TCP/IP.  The option accepts a
                      string argument. See mysql --help for details.
  -p, --password=name This option specifies the password to use when connecting
                      to the database. It accepts a string argument.  See mysql
                      --help for details.
  --protocol=name     The protocol to use for connection (tcp, socket, pipe,
                      memory).
  -S, --socket=name   This option specifies the socket to use when connecting
                      to the local database server with a UNIX domain socket. 
                      The option accepts a string argument. See mysql --help
                      for details.
  --incremental-history-name=name 
                      This option specifies the name of the backup series
                      stored in the PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history history
                      record to base an incremental backup on. Xtrabackup will
                      search the history table looking for the most recent
                      (highest innodb_to_lsn), successful backup in the series
                      and take the to_lsn value to use as the starting lsn for
                      the incremental backup. This will be mutually exclusive
                      with --incremental-history-uuid, --incremental-basedir
                      and --incremental-lsn. If no valid lsn can be found (no
                      series by that name, no successful backups by that name),
                      an error will be returned. It is used with the
                      --incremental option.
  --incremental-history-uuid=name 
                      This option specifies the UUID of the specific history
                      record stored in the PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history to
                      base an incremental backup on.
                      --incremental-history-name, --incremental-basedir and
                      --incremental-lsn. If no valid lsn can be found (no
                      success record with that uuid), an error will be
                      returned. It is used with the --incremental option.
  --remove-original   Remove .qp files after decompression.
  --ftwrl-wait-query-type=name 
                      This option specifies which types of queries are allowed
                      to complete before mariadb-backup will issue the global
                      lock. Default is all.. One of: ALL, UPDATE, SELECT
  --kill-long-query-type=name 
                      This option specifies which types of queries should be
                      killed to unblock the global lock. Default is "all".. One
                      of: ALL, UPDATE, SELECT
  --history[=name]    This option enables the tracking of backup history in the
                      PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history table. An optional
                      history series name may be specified that will be placed
                      with the history record for the current backup being
                      taken.
  --kill-long-queries-timeout=# 
                      This option specifies the number of seconds
                      mariadb-backup waits between starting FLUSH TABLES WITH
                      READ LOCK and killing those queries that block it.
                      Default is 0 seconds, which means mariadb-backup will not
                      attempt to kill any queries.
  --ftwrl-wait-timeout=# 
                      This option specifies time in seconds that mariadb-backup
                      should wait for queries that would block FTWRL before
                      running it. If there are still such queries when the
                      timeout expires, mariadb-backup terminates with an error.
                      Default is 0, in which case mariadb-backup does not wait
                      for queries to complete and starts FTWRL immediately.
  --ftwrl-wait-threshold=# 
                      This option specifies the query run time threshold which
                      is used by mariadb-backup to detect long-running queries
                      with a non-zero value of --ftwrl-wait-timeout. FTWRL is
                      not started until such long-running queries exist. This
                      option has no effect if --ftwrl-wait-timeout is 0.
                      Default value is 60 seconds.
  --safe-slave-backup-timeout=# 
                      How many seconds --safe-slave-backup should wait for
                      Slave_open_temp_tables to become zero. (default 300)
  --binlog-info[=name] 
                      This option controls how backup should retrieve server's
                      binary log coordinates corresponding to the backup.
                      Possible values are OFF, ON, LOCKLESS and AUTO.. One of: 
                      off, lockless, on, auto
  --secure-auth       Refuse client connecting to server if it uses old
                      (pre-4.1.1) protocol.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-secure-auth to disable.)
  --log-innodb-page-corruption 
                      Continue backup if innodb corrupted pages are found. The
                      pages are logged in innodb_corrupted_pages and backup is
                      finished with error. --prepare will try to fix corrupted
                      pages. If innodb_corrupted_pages exists after --prepare
                      in base backup directory, backup still contains corrupted
                      pages and can not be considered as consistent.
  --ssl               Enable SSL for connection (automatically enabled with
                      other flags).
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-ssl to disable.)
  --ssl-ca=name       CA file in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies
                      --ssl).
  --ssl-capath=name   CA directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
  --ssl-cert=name     X509 cert in PEM format (implies --ssl).
  --ssl-cipher=name   SSL cipher to use (implies --ssl).
  --ssl-key=name      X509 key in PEM format (implies --ssl).
  --ssl-crl=name      Certificate revocation list (implies --ssl).
  --ssl-crlpath=name  Certificate revocation list path (implies --ssl).
  --tls-version=name  TLS protocol version for secure connection.
  --ssl-verify-server-cert 
                      Verify server's "Common Name" in its cert against
                      hostname used when connecting. This option is disabled by
                      default.
  -h, --datadir=name  Path to the database root.
  -t, --tmpdir=name   Path for temporary files. Several paths may be specified,
                      separated by a semicolon (;), in this case they are used
                      in a round-robin fashion.
  --parallel=#        Number of threads to use for parallel datafiles transfer.
                      The default value is 1.
  --extended-validation 
                      Enable extended validation for Innodb data pages during
                      backup phase. Will slow down backup considerably, in case
                      encryption is used. May fail if tables are created during
                      the backup.
  --encrypted-backup  In --backup, assume that nonzero key_version implies that
                      the page is encrypted. Use --backup
                      --skip-encrypted-backup to allow copying unencrypted that
                      were originally created before MySQL 5.1.48.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-encrypted-backup to disable.)
  --log[=name]        Ignored option for MySQL option compatibility
  --log-bin[=name]    Base name for the log sequence
  --innodb[=name]     Ignored option for MySQL option compatibility
  --innodb-adaptive-hash-index 
                      Enable InnoDB adaptive hash index (disabled by default).
  --innodb-autoextend-increment=# 
                      Data file autoextend increment in megabytes
  --innodb-data-file-path=name 
                      Path to individual files and their sizes.
  --innodb-data-home-dir=name 
                      The common part for InnoDB table spaces.
