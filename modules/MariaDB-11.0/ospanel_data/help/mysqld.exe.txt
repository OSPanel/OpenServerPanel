mysqld.exe  Ver 11.0.4-MariaDB for Win64 on AMD64 (mariadb.org binary distribution)
Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, Oracle, MariaDB Corporation Ab and others.

Starts the MariaDB database server.

Usage: mysqld.exe [OPTIONS]
NT and Win32 specific options:
  --install                     Install the default service (NT).
  --install-manual              Install the default service started manually (NT).
  --install service_name        Install an optional service (NT).
  --install-manual service_name Install an optional service started manually (NT).
  --remove                      Remove the default service from the service list (NT).
  --remove service_name         Remove the service_name from the service list (NT).
  --enable-named-pipe           Only to be used for the default server (NT).
  --standalone                  Dummy option to start as a standalone server (NT).


Default options are read from the following files in the given order:
C:\Windows\my.ini C:\Windows\my.cnf C:\my.ini C:\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-11.0\data\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-11.0\data\my.cnf C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-11.0\my.ini C:\OSPanel\modules\MariaDB-11.0\my.cnf 
The following groups are read: mysqld server mysqld-11.0 mariadb mariadb-11.0 mariadbd mariadbd-11.0 client-server
The following options may be given as the first argument:
--print-defaults          Print the program argument list and exit.
--no-defaults             Don't read default options from any option file.
The following specify which files/extra groups are read (specified before remaining options):
--defaults-file=#         Only read default options from the given file #.
--defaults-extra-file=#   Read this file after the global files are read.
--defaults-group-suffix=# Additionally read default groups with # appended as a suffix.

  --allow-suspicious-udfs 
                      Allows use of user-defined functions (UDFs) consisting of
                      only one symbol xxx() without corresponding xxx_init() or
                      xxx_deinit(). That also means that one can load any
                      function from any library, for example exit() from
                      libc.so
  --alter-algorithm[=name] 
                      Specify the alter table algorithm. One of: DEFAULT, COPY,
                      INPLACE, NOCOPY, INSTANT
  --analyze-sample-percentage=# 
                      Percentage of rows from the table ANALYZE TABLE will
                      sample to collect table statistics. Set to 0 to let
                      MariaDB decide what percentage of rows to sample.
  -a, --ansi          Use ANSI SQL syntax instead of MySQL syntax. This mode
                      will also set transaction isolation level 'serializable'.
  --aria-block-size=# Block size to be used for Aria index pages.
  --aria-checkpoint-interval=# 
                      Interval between tries to do an automatic checkpoints. In
                      seconds; 0 means 'no automatic checkpoints' which makes
                      sense only for testing.
  --aria-checkpoint-log-activity=# 
                      Number of bytes that the transaction log has to grow
                      between checkpoints before a new checkpoint is written to
                      the log.
  --aria-encrypt-tables 
                      Encrypt tables (only for tables with ROW_FORMAT=PAGE
                      (default) and not FIXED/DYNAMIC)
  --aria-force-start-after-recovery-failures=# 
                      Number of consecutive log recovery failures after which
                      logs will be automatically deleted to cure the problem; 0
                      (the default) disables the feature.
  --aria-group-commit=name 
                      Specifies Aria group commit mode. Possible values are
                      "none" (no group commit), "hard" (with waiting to actual
                      commit), "soft" (no wait for commit (DANGEROUS!!!))
  --aria-group-commit-interval=# 
                      Interval between commits in microseconds (1/1000000 sec).
                      0 stands for no waiting for other threads to come and do
                      a commit in "hard" mode and no sync()/commit at all in
                      "soft" mode.  Option has only an effect if
                      aria_group_commit is used
  --aria-log-dir-path=name 
                      Path to the directory where to store transactional log
  --aria-log-file-size=# 
                      Limit for transaction log size
  --aria-log-purge-type=name 
                      Specifies how Aria transactional log will be purged. One
                      of: immediate, external, at_flush
  --aria-max-sort-file-size=# 
                      Don't use the fast sort index method to created index if
                      the temporary file would get bigger than this.
  --aria-page-checksum 
                      Maintain page checksums (can be overridden per table with
                      PAGE_CHECKSUM clause in CREATE TABLE)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-aria-page-checksum to disable.)
  --aria-pagecache-age-threshold=# 
                      This characterizes the number of hits a hot block has to
                      be untouched until it is considered aged enough to be
                      downgraded to a warm block. This specifies the percentage
                      ratio of that number of hits to the total number of
                      blocks in the page cache.
  --aria-pagecache-buffer-size=# 
                      The size of the buffer used for index blocks for Aria
                      tables. Increase this to get better index handling (for
                      all reads and multiple writes) to as much as you can
                      afford.
  --aria-pagecache-division-limit=# 
                      The minimum percentage of warm blocks in key cache
  --aria-pagecache-file-hash-size=# 
                      Number of hash buckets for open and changed files.  If
                      you have a lot of Aria files open you should increase
                      this for faster flush of changes. A good value is
                      probably 1/10 of number of possible open Aria files.
  --aria-recover-options[=name] 
                      Specifies how corrupted tables should be automatically
                      repaired. Any combination of: NORMAL, BACKUP, FORCE, 
                      QUICK, OFF
  Use 'ALL' to set all combinations.
  --aria-repair-threads=# 
                      Number of threads to use when repairing Aria tables. The
                      value of 1 disables parallel repair.
  --aria-sort-buffer-size=# 
                      The buffer that is allocated when sorting the index when
                      doing a REPAIR or when creating indexes with CREATE INDEX
                      or ALTER TABLE.
  --aria-stats-method=name 
                      Specifies how Aria index statistics collection code
                      should treat NULLs. One of: nulls_unequal, nulls_equal, 
                      nulls_ignored
  --aria-sync-log-dir=name 
                      Controls syncing directory after log file growth and new
                      file creation. One of: NEVER, NEWFILE, ALWAYS
  --auto-increment-increment[=#] 
                      Auto-increment columns are incremented by this
  --auto-increment-offset[=#] 
                      Offset added to Auto-increment columns. Used when
                      auto-increment-increment != 1
  --autocommit        Set default value for autocommit (0 or 1)
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-autocommit to disable.)
  --automatic-sp-privileges 
                      Creating and dropping stored procedures alters ACLs
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-automatic-sp-privileges to disable.)
  --back-log=#        The number of outstanding connection requests MariaDB can
                      have. This comes into play when the main MariaDB thread
                      gets very many connection requests in a very short time
                      (Automatically configured unless set explicitly)
  -b, --basedir=name  Path to installation directory. All paths are usually
                      resolved relative to this
  --big-tables        Old variable, which if set to 1, allows large result sets
                      by saving all temporary sets to disk, avoiding 'table
                      full' errors. No longer needed, as the server now handles
                      this automatically.
  --bind-address=name IP address to bind to. Several addresses may be
                      specified, separated by a comma (,).
  --binlog-alter-two-phase 
                      When set, split ALTER at binary logging into 2
                      statements: START ALTER and COMMIT/ROLLBACK ALTER
  --binlog-annotate-row-events 
                      Tells the master to annotate RBR events with the
                      statement that caused these events
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-annotate-row-events to disable.)
  --binlog-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the transactional cache for updates to
                      transactional engines for the binary log. If you often
                      use transactions containing many statements, you can
                      increase this to get more performance
  --binlog-checksum=name 
                      Type of BINLOG_CHECKSUM_ALG. Include checksum for log
                      events in the binary log. One of: NONE, CRC32
  --binlog-commit-wait-count=# 
                      If non-zero, binlog write will wait at most
                      binlog_commit_wait_usec microseconds for at least this
                      many commits to queue up for group commit to the binlog.
                      This can reduce I/O on the binlog and provide increased
                      opportunity for parallel apply on the slave, but too high
                      a value will decrease commit throughput.
  --binlog-commit-wait-usec=# 
                      Maximum time, in microseconds, to wait for more commits
                      to queue up for binlog group commit. Only takes effect if
                      the value of binlog_commit_wait_count is non-zero.
  --binlog-direct-non-transactional-updates 
                      Causes updates to non-transactional engines using
                      statement format to be written directly to binary log.
                      Before using this option make sure that there are no
                      dependencies between transactional and non-transactional
                      tables such as in the statement INSERT INTO t_myisam
                      SELECT * FROM t_innodb; otherwise, slaves may diverge
                      from the master.
  --binlog-do-db=name Tells the master it should log updates for the specified
                      database, and exclude all others not explicitly
                      mentioned.
  --binlog-expire-logs-seconds=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      binlog_expire_logs_seconds seconds; It and
                      expire_logs_days are linked, such that changes in one are
                      converted into the other. Possible purges happen at
                      startup and at binary log rotation.
  --binlog-file-cache-size=# 
                      The size of file cache for the binary log
  --binlog-format=name 
                      What form of binary logging the master will use: either
                      ROW for row-based binary logging, STATEMENT for
                      statement-based binary logging, or MIXED. MIXED is
                      statement-based binary logging except for those
                      statements where only row-based is correct: those which
                      involve user-defined functions (i.e. UDFs) or the UUID()
                      function; for those, row-based binary logging is
                      automatically used.
  --binlog-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the master that updates to the given database
                      should not be logged to the binary log.
  --binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling 
                      Run fast part of group commit in a single thread, to
                      optimize kernel thread scheduling. On by default. Disable
                      to run each transaction in group commit in its own
                      thread, which can be slower at very high concurrency.
                      This option is mostly for testing one algorithm versus
                      the other, and it should not normally be necessary to
                      change it.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-binlog-optimize-thread-scheduling to disable.)
  --binlog-row-event-max-size=# 
                      The maximum size of a row-based binary log event in
                      bytes. Rows will be grouped into events smaller than this
                      size if possible. The value has to be a multiple of 256.
  --binlog-row-image=name 
                      Controls whether rows should be logged in 'FULL',
                      'NOBLOB' or 'MINIMAL' formats. 'FULL', means that all
                      columns in the before and after image are logged.
                      'NOBLOB', means that mysqld avoids logging blob columns
                      whenever possible (eg, blob column was not changed or is
                      not part of primary key). 'MINIMAL', means that a PK
                      equivalent (PK columns or full row if there is no PK in
                      the table) is logged in the before image, and only
                      changed columns are logged in the after image. (Default:
                      FULL).
  --binlog-row-metadata=name 
                      Controls whether metadata is logged using FULL , MINIMAL
                      format and NO_LOG.FULL causes all metadata to be logged;
                      MINIMAL means that only metadata actually required by
                      slave is logged; NO_LOG NO metadata will be
                      logged.Default: NO_LOG.
  --binlog-stmt-cache-size=# 
                      The size of the statement cache for updates to
                      non-transactional engines for the binary log. If you
                      often use statements updating a great number of rows, you
                      can increase this to get more performance.
  --bootstrap         Used by mysql installation scripts.
  --bulk-insert-buffer-size=# 
                      Size of tree cache used in bulk insert optimisation. Note
                      that this is a limit per thread!
  --character-set-client-handshake 
                      Don't ignore client side character set value sent during
                      handshake.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-character-set-client-handshake to disable.)
  --character-set-filesystem=name 
                      Set the filesystem character set.
  -C, --character-set-server=name 
                      Set the default character set.
  --character-sets-dir=name 
                      Directory where character sets are
  -r, --chroot=name   Chroot mysqld daemon during startup.
  --collation-server=name 
                      Set the default collation.
  --column-compression-threshold=# 
                      Minimum column data length eligible for compression
  --column-compression-zlib-level=# 
                      zlib compression level (1 gives best speed, 9 gives best
                      compression)
  --column-compression-zlib-strategy=name 
                      The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression
                      algorithm. Use the value DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal
                      data, FILTERED for data produced by a filter (or
                      predictor), HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only
                      (no string match), or RLE to limit match distances to one
                      (run-length encoding). Filtered data consists mostly of
                      small values with a somewhat random distribution. In this
                      case, the compression algorithm is tuned to compress them
                      better. The effect of FILTERED is to force more Huffman
                      coding and less string matching; it is somewhat
                      intermediate between DEFAULT_STRATEGY and HUFFMAN_ONLY.
                      RLE is designed to be almost as fast as HUFFMAN_ONLY, but
                      give better compression for PNG image data. The strategy
                      parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the
                      correctness of the compressed output even if it is not
                      set appropriately. FIXED prevents the use of dynamic
                      Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler decoder for special
                      applications.
  --column-compression-zlib-wrap 
                      Generate zlib header and trailer and compute adler32
                      check value. It can be used with storage engines that
                      don't provide data integrity verification to detect data
                      corruption.
  --completion-type=name 
                      The transaction completion type. One of: NO_CHAIN, CHAIN,
                      RELEASE
  --concurrent-insert[=name] 
                      Use concurrent insert with MyISAM. One of: NEVER, AUTO, 
                      ALWAYS
  --connect-timeout=# The number of seconds the mysqld server is waiting for a
                      connect packet before responding with 'Bad handshake'
  --console           Write error output on screen; don't remove the console
                      window on windows.
  --core-file         Write core on crashes
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-core-file to disable.)
  -h, --datadir=name  Path to the database root directory

                      debugging!
  --debug-no-thread-alarm 
                      Disable system thread alarm calls. Disabling it may be
                      useful in debugging or testing, never do it in production
  --debug-sporadic-binlog-dump-fail 
                      Option used by mysql-test for debugging and testing of
                      replication.
  --default-password-lifetime=# 
                      This defines the global password expiration policy. 0
                      means automatic password expiration is disabled. If the
                      value is a positive integer N, the passwords must be
                      changed every N days. This behavior can be overridden
                      using the password expiration options in ALTER USER.
  --default-regex-flags=name 
                      Default flags for the regex library. Any combination of: 
                      DOTALL, DUPNAMES, EXTENDED, EXTENDED_MORE, EXTRA, 
                      MULTILINE, UNGREEDY
  Use 'ALL' to set all combinations.
  --default-storage-engine=name 
                      The default storage engine for new tables
  --default-time-zone=name 
                      Set the default time zone.
  --default-tmp-storage-engine=name 
                      The default storage engine for user-created temporary
                      tables
  --default-week-format=# 
                      The default week format used by WEEK() functions
  --delay-key-write[=name] 
                      Specifies how MyISAM tables handles CREATE TABLE
                      DELAY_KEY_WRITE. If set to ON, the default, any DELAY KEY
                      WRITEs are honored. The key buffer is then flushed only
                      when the table closes, speeding up writes. MyISAM tables
                      should be automatically checked upon startup in this
                      case, and --external locking should not be used, as it
                      can lead to index corruption. If set to OFF, DELAY KEY
                      WRITEs are ignored, while if set to ALL, all new opened
                      tables are treated as if created with DELAY KEY WRITEs
                      enabled.
  --delayed-insert-limit=# 
                      After inserting delayed_insert_limit rows, the INSERT
                      DELAYED handler will check if there are any SELECT
                      statements pending. If so, it allows these to execute
                      before continuing.
  --delayed-insert-timeout=# 
                      How long a INSERT DELAYED thread should wait for INSERT
                      statements before terminating
  --delayed-queue-size=# 
                      What size queue (in rows) should be allocated for
                      handling INSERT DELAYED. If the queue becomes full, any
                      client that does INSERT DELAYED will wait until there is
                      room in the queue again
  --des-key-file=name Load keys for des_encrypt() and des_encrypt from given
                      file.
  --disconnect-on-expired-password 
                      This variable controls how the server handles clients
                      that are not aware of the sandbox mode. If enabled, the
                      server disconnects the client, otherwise the server puts
                      the client in a sandbox mode.
  --div-precision-increment=# 
                      Precision of the result of '/' operator will be increased
                      on that value
  --encrypt-binlog    Encrypt binary logs (including relay logs)
  --encrypt-tmp-disk-tables 
                      Encrypt temporary on-disk tables (created as part of
                      query execution)
  --encrypt-tmp-files Encrypt temporary files (created for filesort, binary log
                      cache, etc)
  --enforce-storage-engine=name 
                      Force the use of a storage engine for new tables
  --eq-range-index-dive-limit=# 
                      The optimizer will use existing index statistics instead
                      of doing index dives for equality ranges if the number of
                      equality ranges for the index is larger than or equal to
                      this number. If set to 0, index dives are always used.
  --event-scheduler[=name] 
                      Enable the event scheduler. Possible values are ON, OFF,
                      and DISABLED (keep the event scheduler completely
                      deactivated, it cannot be activated run-time)
  --expensive-subquery-limit=# 
                      The maximum number of rows a subquery may examine in
                      order to be executed during optimization and used for
                      constant optimization
  --expire-logs-days=# 
                      If non-zero, binary logs will be purged after
                      expire_logs_days days; It and binlog_expire_logs_seconds
                      are linked, such that changes in one are converted into
                      the other, presentable as a decimal value with 1/1000000
                      of the day precision; possible purges happen at startup
                      and at binary log rotation
  --explicit-defaults-for-timestamp 
                      This option causes CREATE TABLE to create all TIMESTAMP
                      columns as NULL with DEFAULT NULL attribute, Without this
                      option, TIMESTAMP columns are NOT NULL and have implicit
                      DEFAULT clauses.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-explicit-defaults-for-timestamp to disable.)
  --external-locking  Use system (external) locking (disabled by default). 
                      With this option enabled you can run myisamchk to test
                      (not repair) tables while the MySQL server is running.
                      Disable with --skip-external-locking.
  --extra-max-connections=# 
                      The number of connections on extra-port
  --extra-port=#      Extra port number to use for tcp connections in a
                      one-thread-per-connection manner. 0 means don't use
                      another port
  --feedback[=name]   Enable or disable FEEDBACK plugin. One of: ON, OFF, FORCE
                      (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).

                      feedback report.
  --flashback         Setup the server to use flashback. This enables binary
                      log in row mode and will enable extra logging for DDL's
                      needed by flashback feature
  --flush             Flush MyISAM tables to disk between SQL commands
  --flush-time=#      A dedicated thread is created to flush all tables at the

                      prefixes.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-getopt-prefix-matching to disable.)

                      The maximum length of the result of function
                      GROUP_CONCAT()
  --gssapi[=name]     Enable or disable gssapi plugin. One of: ON, OFF, FORCE
                      (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).

  --gtid-cleanup-batch-size=# 
                      Normally does not need tuning. How many old rows must
                      accumulate in the mysql.gtid_slave_pos table before a
                      background job will be run to delete them. Can be
                      increased to reduce number of commits if using many
                      different engines with --gtid_pos_auto_engines, or to
                      reduce CPU overhead if using a huge number of different
                      gtid_domain_ids. Can be decreased to reduce number of old
                      rows in the table.
  --gtid-domain-id=#  Used with global transaction ID to identify logically
                      independent replication streams. When events can
                      propagate through multiple parallel paths (for example
                      multiple masters), each independent source server must
                      use a distinct domain_id. For simple tree-shaped
                      replication topologies, it can be left at its default, 0.
  --gtid-ignore-duplicates 
                      When set, different master connections in multi-source
                      replication are allowed to receive and process event
                      groups with the same GTID (when using GTID mode). Only
                      one will be applied, any others will be ignored. Within a
                      given replication domain, just the sequence number will
                      be used to decide whether a given GTID has been already
                      applied; this means it is the responsibility of the user
                      to ensure that GTID sequence numbers are strictly
                      increasing.
  --gtid-pos-auto-engines=name 
                      List of engines for which to automatically create a
                      mysql.gtid_slave_pos_ENGINE table, if a transaction using
                      that engine is replicated. This can be used to avoid
                      introducing cross-engine transactions, if engines are
                      used different from that used by table
                      mysql.gtid_slave_pos
  --gtid-strict-mode  Enforce strict seq_no ordering of events in the binary
                      log. Slave stops with an error if it encounters an event
                      that would cause it to generate an out-of-order binlog if
                      executed. When ON the same server-id semisync-replicated
                      transactions that duplicate existing ones in binlog are
                      ignored without error and slave interruption.
  -?, --help          Display this help and exit.
  --histogram-size=#  Number of bytes used for a histogram. If set to 0, no
                      histograms are created by ANALYZE.
  --histogram-type=name 
                      Specifies type of the histograms created by ANALYZE.
                      Possible values are: SINGLE_PREC_HB - single precision
                      height-balanced, DOUBLE_PREC_HB - double precision
                      height-balanced, JSON_HB - height-balanced, stored as
                      JSON.

  --ignore-builtin-innodb 
                      Disable initialization of builtin InnoDB plugin
  --ignore-db-dirs=name 
                      Specifies a directory to add to the ignore list when
                      collecting database names from the datadir. Put a blank
                      argument to reset the list accumulated so far.
  --in-predicate-conversion-threshold=# 
                      The minimum number of scalar elements in the value list
                      of IN predicate that triggers its conversion to IN
                      subquery. Set to 0 to disable the conversion.

                      be uninstalled).
  --innodb-adaptive-flushing 
                      Attempt flushing dirty pages to avoid IO bursts at
                      checkpoints.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-innodb-adaptive-flushing to disable.)
  --innodb-adaptive-flushing-lwm=# 
                      Percentage of log capacity below which no adaptive
                      flushing happens.
  --innodb-adaptive-hash-index

                      pool dump status in percentages should be printed. E.g.
                      10 means that buffer pool dump status is printed when
                      every 10% of number of buffer pool pages are dumped.
                      Default is 0 (only start and end status is printed).

                      innodb_defragment_fill_factor_n_recs, is introduced so
                      defragmentation won't pack the page too full and cause
                      page split on the next insert on every page. The variable
                      indicating more defragmentation gain is the one
                      effective.
  --innodb-defragment-fill-factor-n-recs=# 
                      How many records of space defragmentation should leave on

                      defragmentation thread can request X_LOCK on an index.
                      Defragmentation thread will check whether
                      1/defragment_frequency (s) has passed since it worked on
                      this index last time, and put the index back to the queue
                      if not enough time has passed. The actual frequency can
                      only be lower than this given number.
  --innodb-defragment-n-pages=#

                      Key rotation - re-encrypt in background all pages that
                      were encrypted with a key that many (or more) versions
                      behind. Value 0 indicates that key rotation is disabled.

  --innodb-flush-log-at-timeout[=#] 
                      Write and flush logs every (n) second.
  --innodb-flush-log-at-trx-commit[=#] 
                      Controls the durability/speed trade-off for commits. Set
                      to 0 (write and flush redo log to disk only once per
                      second), 1 (flush to disk at each commit), 2 (write to
                      log at commit but flush to disk only once per second) or
                      3 (flush to disk at prepare and at commit, slower and
                      usually redundant). 1 and 3 guarantees that after a
                      crash, committed transactions will not be lost and will
                      be consistent with the binlog and other transactional
                      engines. 2 can get inconsistent and lose transactions if
                      there is a power failure or kernel crash but not if
                      mysqld crashes. 0 has no guarantees in case of crash. 0
                      and 2 can be faster than 1 or 3.

                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-local-infile to disable.)
  --lock-wait-timeout=# 
                      Timeout in seconds to wait for a lock before returning an
                      error.
  --log-basename=name Basename for all log files and the .pid file. This sets
                      all log file names at once (in 'datadir') and is normally
                      the only option you need for specifying log files. Sets
                      names for --log-bin, --log-bin-index, --relay-log,
                      --relay-log-index, --general-log-file,
                      --log-slow-query-file, --log-error-file, and --pid-file
  --log-bin[=name]    Log update queries in binary format. Optional argument
                      should be name for binary log. If not given
                      'datadir'/'log-basename'-bin or 'datadir'/mysql-bin will
                      be used (the later if --log-basename is not specified).
                      We strongly recommend to use either --log-basename or
                      specify a filename to ensure that replication doesn't
                      stop if the real hostname of the computer changes.

  --log-bin-trust-function-creators 
                      If set to FALSE (the default), then when --log-bin is
                      used, creation of a stored function (or trigger) is
                      allowed only to users having the SUPER privilege and only
                      if this stored function (trigger) may not break binary
                      logging. Note that if ALL connections to this server
                      ALWAYS use row-based binary logging, the security issues
                      do not exist and the binary logging cannot break, so you
                      can safely set this to TRUE
  --log-ddl-recovery=name

                      The maximum weight of the SEL_ARG graph. Set to 0 for no
                      limit

                      The maximum number of SEL_ARG objects created when
                      optimizing a range. If more objects would be needed, the
                      range will not be used by the optimizer.
  --optimizer-prune-level=# 
                      Controls the heuristic(s) applied during query
                      optimization to prune less-promising partial plans from
                      the optimizer search space. Meaning: 0 - do not apply any
                      heuristic, thus perform exhaustive search: 1 - prune
                      plans based on cost and number of retrieved rows eq_ref:
                      2 - prune also if we find an eq_ref chain

                      Maximum depth of search performed by the query optimizer.
                      Values larger than the number of relations in a query
                      result in better query plans, but take longer to compile
                      a query. Values smaller than the number of tables in a
                      relation result in faster optimization, but may produce
                      very bad query plans. If set to 0, the system will
                      automatically pick a reasonable value.
  --optimizer-selectivity-sampling-limit=#

  --optimizer-trace-max-mem-size=# 
                      Maximum allowed size of an optimizer trace
  --optimizer-use-condition-selectivity=# 
                      Controls selectivity of which conditions the optimizer
                      takes into account to calculate cardinality of a partial
                      join when it searches for the best execution plan
                      Meaning: 1 - use selectivity of index backed range
                      conditions to calculate the cardinality of a partial join
                      if the last joined table is accessed by full table scan
                      or an index scan, 2 - use selectivity of index backed
                      range conditions to calculate the cardinality of a
                      partial join in any case, 3 - additionally always use
                      selectivity of range conditions that are not backed by
                      any index to calculate the cardinality of a partial join,
                      4 - use histograms to calculate selectivity of range
                      conditions that are not backed by any index to calculate
                      the cardinality of a partial join.5 - additionally use
                      selectivity of certain non-range predicates calculated on
                      record samples
  --optimizer-where-cost=# 
                      Cost of checking the row against the WHERE clause.
                      Increasing this will have the optimizer to prefer plans
                      with less row combinations.

                      progress reporting.
  --proxy-protocol-networks=name 
                      Enable proxy protocol for these source networks. The
                      syntax is a comma separated list of IPv4 and IPv6
                      networks. If the network doesn't contain mask, it is
                      considered to be a single host. "*" represents all
                      networks and must the only directive on the line. String
                      "localhost" represents non-TCP local connections (Unix
                      domain socket, Windows named pipe or shared memory).

                      Strip all comments from a query before storing it in the
                      query cache
  --query-cache-type=name 
                      OFF = Don't cache or retrieve results. ON = Cache all
                      results except SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE ... queries. DEMAND =
                      Cache only SELECT SQL_CACHE ... queries
  --query-cache-wlock-invalidate 
                      Invalidate queries in query cache on LOCK for write
  --query-prealloc-size=# 
                      Persistent buffer for query parsing and execution
  --range-alloc-block-size=# 
                      Allocation block size for storing ranges during
                      optimization
  --read-binlog-speed-limit=# 
                      Maximum speed(KB/s) to read binlog from master (0 = no
                      limit)
  --read-buffer-size=# 
                      Each thread that does a sequential scan allocates a
                      buffer of this size for each table it scans. If you do
                      many sequential scans, you may want to increase this
                      value
  --read-only         Make all non-temporary tables read-only, with the
                      exception for replication (slave) threads and users with
                      the 'READ ONLY ADMIN' privilege
  --read-rnd-buffer-size=# 
                      When reading rows in sorted order after a sort, the rows
                      are read through this buffer to avoid a disk seeks
  --relay-log=name    The location and name to use for relay logs.
  --relay-log-index=name 
                      The location and name to use for the file that keeps a
                      list of the last relay logs
  --relay-log-info-file=name 
                      The location and name of the file that remembers where
                      the SQL replication thread is in the relay logs.
  --relay-log-purge   if disabled - do not purge relay logs. if enabled - purge
                      them as soon as they are no more needed.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-relay-log-purge to disable.)
  --relay-log-recovery 
                      Enables automatic relay log recovery right after the
                      database startup, which means that the IO Thread starts
                      re-fetching from the master right after the last
                      transaction processed.
  --relay-log-space-limit=# 
                      Maximum space to use for all relay logs
  --replicate-annotate-row-events 
                      Tells the slave to write annotate rows events received
                      from the master to its own binary log. Ignored if
                      log_slave_updates is not set
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-replicate-annotate-row-events to disable.)
  --replicate-do-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified database. To specify more than one database,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      Note that this will only work if you do not use
                      cross-database queries such as UPDATE some_db.some_table
                      SET foo='bar' while having selected a different or no
                      database. If you need cross database updates to work,
                      make sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-do-table=db_name.%.
  --replicate-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      specified table. To specify more than one table, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-do-db.
  --replicate-events-marked-for-skip=name 
                      Whether the slave should replicate events that were
                      created with @@skip_replication=1 on the master. Default
                      REPLICATE (no events are skipped). Other values are
                      FILTER_ON_SLAVE (events will be sent by the master but
                      ignored by the slave) and FILTER_ON_MASTER (events marked
                      with @@skip_replication=1 will be filtered on the master
                      and never be sent to the slave).
  --replicate-ignore-db=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      database. To specify more than one database to ignore,
                      use the directive multiple times, once for each database.
                      This option will not work if you use cross database
                      updates. If you need cross database updates to work, make
                      sure you have 3.23.28 or later, and use
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=db_name.%. 
  --replicate-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the specified
                      table. To specify more than one table to ignore, use the
                      directive multiple times, once for each table. This will
                      work for cross-database updates, in contrast to
                      replicate-ignore-db.
  --replicate-rewrite-db=name 
                      Updates to a database with a different name than the
                      original. Example:
                      replicate-rewrite-db=master_db_name->slave_db_name.
  --replicate-same-server-id 
                      In replication, if set to 1, do not skip events having
                      our server id. Default value is 0 (to break infinite
                      loops in circular replication). Can't be set to 1 if
                      --log-slave-updates is used.
  --replicate-wild-do-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to restrict replication to the
                      tables that match the specified wildcard pattern. To
                      specify more than one table, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-do-table=foo%.bar% will replicate only
                      updates to tables in all databases that start with foo
                      and whose table names start with bar.
  --replicate-wild-ignore-table=name 
                      Tells the slave thread to not replicate to the tables
                      that match the given wildcard pattern. To specify more
                      than one table to ignore, use the directive multiple
                      times, once for each table. This will work for
                      cross-database updates. Example:
                      replicate-wild-ignore-table=foo%.bar% will not do updates
                      to tables in databases that start with foo and whose
                      table names start with bar.
  --report-host=name  Hostname or IP of the slave to be reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Will appear in the output of
                      SHOW SLAVE HOSTS. Leave unset if you do not want the
                      slave to register itself with the master. Note that it is
                      not sufficient for the master to simply read the IP of
                      the slave off the socket once the slave connects. Due to
                      NAT and other routing issues, that IP may not be valid
                      for connecting to the slave from the master or other
                      hosts
  --report-password=name 
                      The account password of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --report-port=#     Port for connecting to slave reported to the master
                      during slave registration. Set it only if the slave is
                      listening on a non-default port or if you have a special
                      tunnel from the master or other clients to the slave. If
                      not sure, leave this option unset
  --report-user=name  The account user name of the slave to be reported to the
                      master during slave registration
  --require-secure-transport 
                      When this option is enabled, connections attempted using
                      insecure transport will be rejected. Secure transports
                      are SSL/TLS, Unix sockets or named pipes.
  --rowid-merge-buff-size=#

                      Enable semi-synchronous replication master (disabled by
                      default).
  --rpl-semi-sync-master-timeout=# 
                      The timeout value (in ms) for semi-synchronous
                      replication in the master
  --rpl-semi-sync-master-trace-level=# 
                      The tracing level for semi-sync replication.
  --rpl-semi-sync-master-wait-no-slave 
                      Wait until timeout when no semi-synchronous replication
                      slave available (enabled by default).
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-rpl-semi-sync-master-wait-no-slave to disable.)
  --rpl-semi-sync-master-wait-point=name 
                      Should transaction wait for semi-sync ack after having
                      synced binlog, or after having committed in storage
                      engine.. One of: AFTER_SYNC, AFTER_COMMIT
  --rpl-semi-sync-slave-delay-master 
                      Only write master info file when ack is needed.
  --rpl-semi-sync-slave-enabled 
                      Enable semi-synchronous replication slave (disabled by
                      default).
  --rpl-semi-sync-slave-kill-conn-timeout[=#] 
                      Timeout for the mysql connection used to kill the slave
                      io_thread's connection on master. This timeout comes into
                      play when stop slave is executed.
  --rpl-semi-sync-slave-trace-level=# 
                      The tracing level for semi-sync replication.
  --safe-mode         Skip some optimize stages (for testing). Deprecated.
  --safe-user-create  Don't allow new user creation by the user who has no
                      write privileges to the mysql.user table.
  --secure-auth       Disallow authentication for accounts that have old
                      (pre-4.1) passwords
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-secure-auth to disable.)
  --secure-file-priv=name 
                      Limit LOAD DATA, SELECT ... OUTFILE, and LOAD_FILE() to
                      files within specified directory
  --secure-timestamp=name 
                      Restricts direct setting of a session timestamp. Possible
                      levels are: YES - timestamp cannot deviate from the
                      system clock, REPLICATION - replication thread can adjust
                      timestamp to match the master's, SUPER - a user with this
                      privilege and a replication thread can adjust timestamp,
                      NO - historical behavior, anyone can modify session
                      timestamp
  --sequence[=name]   Enable or disable SEQUENCE plugin. One of: ON, OFF, FORCE
                      (don't start if the plugin fails to load),
                      FORCE_PLUS_PERMANENT (like FORCE, but the plugin can not
                      be uninstalled).
  --server-id=#       Uniquely identifies the server instance in the community
                      of replication partners
  --session-track-schema 
                      Track changes to the default schema.
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-session-track-schema to disable.)
  --session-track-state-change 
                      Track changes to the session state.
  --session-track-system-variables=name 
                      Track changes in registered system variables. 
  --session-track-transaction-info=name 
                      Track changes to the transaction attributes. OFF to
                      disable; STATE to track just transaction state (Is there
                      an active transaction? Does it have any data? etc.);
                      CHARACTERISTICS to track transaction state and report all
                      statements needed to start a transaction with the same
                      characteristics (isolation level, read only/read
                      write,snapshot - but not any work done / data modified
                      within the transaction).
  --show-slave-auth-info 
                      Show user and password in SHOW SLAVE HOSTS on this
                      master.
  --silent-startup    Don't print [Note] to the error log during startup.
  --skip-grant-tables Start without grant tables. This gives all users FULL
                      ACCESS to all tables.
  --skip-host-cache   Don't cache host names.
  --skip-name-resolve Don't resolve hostnames. All hostnames are IP's or
                      'localhost'.
  --skip-networking   Don't allow connection with TCP/IP
  --skip-show-database 
                      Don't allow 'SHOW DATABASE' commands

  --slave-compressed-protocol 
                      Use compression on master/slave protocol
  --slave-ddl-exec-mode=name 
                      How replication events should be executed. Legal values
                      are STRICT and IDEMPOTENT (default). In IDEMPOTENT mode,
                      replication will not stop for DDL operations that are
                      idempotent. This means that CREATE TABLE is treated as
                      CREATE TABLE OR REPLACE and DROP TABLE is treated as DROP
                      TABLE IF EXISTS.
  --slave-domain-parallel-threads=# 
                      Maximum number of parallel threads to use on slave for
                      events in a single replication domain. When using
                      multiple domains, this can be used to limit a single
                      domain from grabbing all threads and thus stalling other
                      domains. The default of 0 means to allow a domain to grab
                      as many threads as it wants, up to the value of
                      slave_parallel_threads.
  --slave-exec-mode=name 
                      How replication events should be executed. Legal values
                      are STRICT (default) and IDEMPOTENT. In IDEMPOTENT mode,
                      replication will not stop for operations that are
                      idempotent. For example, in row based replication
                      attempts to delete rows that doesn't exist will be
                      ignored. In STRICT mode, replication will stop on any
                      unexpected difference between the master and the slave.
  --slave-load-tmpdir=name 
                      The location where the slave should put its temporary
                      files when replicating a LOAD DATA INFILE command
  --slave-max-allowed-packet=# 
                      The maximum packet length to sent successfully from the
                      master to slave.
  --slave-max-statement-time=# 
                      A query that has taken more than slave_max_statement_time
                      seconds to run on the slave will be aborted. The argument
                      will be treated as a decimal value with microsecond
                      precision. A value of 0 (default) means no timeout
  --slave-net-timeout=# 
                      Number of seconds to wait for more data from any
                      master/slave connection before aborting the read
  --slave-parallel-max-queued=# 
                      Limit on how much memory SQL threads should use per
                      parallel replication thread when reading ahead in the
                      relay log looking for opportunities for parallel
                      replication. Only used when --slave-parallel-threads > 0.
  --slave-parallel-mode=name 
                      Controls what transactions are applied in parallel when
                      using --slave-parallel-threads. Possible values:
                      "optimistic" tries to apply most transactional DML in
                      parallel, and handles any conflicts with rollback and
                      retry. "conservative" limits parallelism in an effort to
                      avoid any conflicts. "aggressive" tries to maximise the
                      parallelism, possibly at the cost of increased conflict
                      rate. "minimal" only parallelizes the commit steps of
                      transactions. "none" disables parallel apply completely.
  --slave-parallel-threads=# 
                      If non-zero, number of threads to spawn to apply in
                      parallel events on the slave that were group-committed on
                      the master or were logged with GTID in different
                      replication domains. Note that these threads are in
                      addition to the IO and SQL threads, which are always
                      created by a replication slave
  --slave-parallel-workers=# 
                      Alias for slave_parallel_threads
  --slave-run-triggers-for-rbr=name 
                      Modes for how triggers in row-base replication on slave
                      side will be executed. Legal values are NO (default),
                      YES, LOGGING and ENFORCE. NO means that trigger for RBR
                      will not be running on slave. YES and LOGGING means that
                      triggers will be running on slave, if there was not
                      triggers running on the master for the statement. LOGGING
                      also means results of that the executed triggers work
                      will be written to the binlog. ENFORCE means that
                      triggers will always be run on the slave, even if there
                      are triggers on the master. ENFORCE implies LOGGING.

                      Force checksum verification of replication events after
                      reading them from relay log. Note: Events are always
                      checksum-verified by slave on receiving them from the
                      network before writing them to the relay log
                      (Defaults to on; use --skip-slave-sql-verify-checksum to disable.)
  --slave-transaction-retries=#

                      provided list. Deadlock error, elapsed lock wait timeout,
                      net read error, net read timeout, net write error, net
                      write timeout, connect error and 2 types of lost
